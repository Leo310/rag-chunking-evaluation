What four stages are key for building good habits?,"['ought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.\n\nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won\'t have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won\'t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you\'ll have no reason to do it again in the future.\n\nWe chase rewards because they:\n\n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\n\nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.\n\nIf we keep these stages in mind then:\n\n- To build good habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it obvious\n    - Craving: Make it attractive\n    - Response: Make it easy\n    - Reward: Make it satisfying\n\n- To break bad habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it invisible\n    - Craving: Make it unattractive\n    - Response: Make it difficult\n    - Reward: Make it unsatisfying\n\n## Select which habits you want to work with\n\nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones.
