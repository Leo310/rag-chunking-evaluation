What is the relationship between time anxiety and the capitalist system?,"['# Anticapitalist approach to time management\nTime management is being used to perpetrate the now hegemonic capitalist values. Its a pity because the underlying concepts are pretty useful and interesting but they are oriented towards improving productivity and being able to deal with an increasing amount of work. Basically they\'re always telling you to be a better cog. It doesn\'t matter how good you are, there is always room for improvement. I\'ve fallen on this trap for a long time (I\'m still getting my head out of the hole) and I\'m trying to amend things by applying the concepts on an anticapitalist mindset. The turning point was to read [Four thousand weeks: Time management for mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), the article will have book extracts mixed with my way of thinking.  \nSome (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person. You need to be at a certain level of the social ladder to even start thinking in these terms. And depending on the number of oppressions you\'re suffering you\'ll have more or less room to maneuver. That margin is completely outside our control so by no means we should feel guilty of not being able to manage time. What follows are just guidelines to deal with this time anxiety imposed by the capitalist system with whatever air we have to breath.']","Time anxiety is imposed by the capitalist system, which uses time management to perpetuate hegemonic capitalist values.
