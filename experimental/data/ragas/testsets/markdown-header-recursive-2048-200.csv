What is the significance of chaining small habits in the process of habit stacking?,"['### Habit stacking  \nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.']","The significance of chaining small habits in the process of habit stacking is that once you have mastered the basic structure of tying a new habit to an established one, you can create larger stacks by linking multiple small habits together. This allows for the development of more complex routines based on existing behaviors.",simple,"[{'h_1': 'How to change a habit', 'h_2': 'Working with the habit cues', 'h_3': 'Habit stacking', 'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/habit_management.md', 'id': 60}]",True
What are the consequences of treating time as a resource?,"['The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.  \nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.  \nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".  \nUltimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.']","The consequences of treating time as a resource include feeling pressure to use it efficiently, leading to self-beratement for perceived waste. This mindset can bind one's sense of self-worth to time management, making it difficult to simply live in the moment. It creates a rigged game where one never feels they are doing well enough, causing a focus on future goals rather than present experiences. Ultimately, it can lead to a life spent worrying about the future and makes it hard to experience the flow of life.",simple,"[{'h_1': 'Anticapitalist approach to time management', 'h_2': 'Changing the mindset', 'h_3': 'Time is not a resource to spend', 'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/time_management.md', 'id': 140}]",True
What's the role of cues and rewards in good vs. bad habits?,"['- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.  \nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.  \nIf we keep these stages in mind then:  \n- To build good habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it obvious\n- Craving: Make it attractive\n- Response: Make it easy\n- Reward: Make it satisfying  \n- To break bad habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it invisible\n- Craving: Make it unattractive\n- Response: Make it difficult\n- Reward: Make it unsatisfying']","Cues and rewards play a crucial role in the formation and breaking of habits. To build good habits, cues should be made obvious, cravings should be made attractive, responses should be made easy, and rewards should be made satisfying.

How do specific cues in habits help with distractions and behavior change?,"['### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change  \nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location.
