What is the purpose of anonymous feedback among organizational members?,The purpose of anonymous feedback among organizational members is to share feedback with teammates or other members while protecting their identities.,"['# How to request anonymous feedback  \nWhen requesting for anonymous feedback on an organizational level, it is\nnecessary to:  \n* *Set expectations for employees*: Let your colleagues know how important their\nfeedback is to the organization. Also, assure them that their responses will\nbe non-identifiable (no identifiable names, titles, or other demographic\ndetails). According to a [Harvard Business Review\narticle](https://hbr.org/2002/02/getting-the-truth-into-workplace-surveys),\n“respondents are much more likely to participate if they are confident that\npersonal anonymity is guaranteed.” Set those expectations to increase the\nchances of response from them.\n* *Deploy a feedback platform*: Use a trusted feedback platform to send feedback\nrequests to the rest of the employees.'
 'attention than those raised by the rest of the group. However, when feedback\nis collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus\nentirely on the feedback.  \n* *It encourages new employees to share their opinions*:\n[Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0893318905279191)\nhas shown that new employees, who happen to be less senior or influential,\nsee anonymous feedback as more appropriate for formal and informal\nevaluations than their older colleagues. Typically, the last thing a new\nemployee wants is to start on the wrong foot, so they maintain a neutral\nstance. Using anonymous feedback can make new employees feel\nmore comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues.  \nCons of Anonymous Feedback:  \n* *It can breed hostility*: According to this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely),\nanonymity often sets off a “witch hunt”, where leaders seek to know the\nsource of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind\nanonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or\nleaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as\na personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their\nemployees.  \n* *It can be less impactful than attributed feedback*: When using attributed\nfeedback where responses carry the employees’ names, information can be\nanalyzed for relevance and impact. However, with anonymous feedback, it can\nbe difficult to analyze information accurately. It is not uncommon for\ncompanies who choose to practice anonymous feedback, to find less specific\nresponses since details may reveal respondents’ identities. Vague feedback\nfrom employees would have less power to influence behaviors or drive change\nin the organization.  \n* *It can be difficult to act on*: Since anonymous feedback is often difficult\nto trace, it can be challenging for the organization to get context or\nfollow up on important issues, especially when a problem is peculiar to an'

 ""# Pros and cons  \nPros of Anonymous Feedback:  \n* *Employees can express themselves freely and provide valuable insights*: On\ntopics that are considered sensitive, you’ll often find employees who are\nafraid to share their opinions. But when employees have the option to use\nanonymous feedback, you will be offering a safe space for them to share\ntheir honest, constructive feedback about sensitive workplace issues,\nwithout fear of being judged, victimized, radicalized or labelled in any\nway.  \nA formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\nsuperficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without\nmentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that\nno one talks about because they know they are so important that they could\nstir things up.  \nIn fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\nbrought to the table as soon as possible. They should be addressed by the\nentire team before they become a source of unhappiness, conflict and lack of\nproductivity.  \nAn anonymous feedback instrument gives you real power over those issues\nbecause it doesn't matter who brought it up, but that it’s resolved. For\na manager, that insight is invaluable.  \n* *It builds trust*: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management\nreacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and\nsometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied\nand build up self esteem.  \n* *It offers a sense of security*: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and\ncreates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions.  \n* *It allows every voice to be heard and respected*: In workplaces, where they\npractice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some\nvoices over others. Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher\nauthority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention.\nIn such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate""
 ""# How to Act on Anonymous Feedback  \nOnce you have sent the anonymous feedback, be sure to:  \n* *Gather and share the findings*: A significant issue with employee feedback is\nthat the data often ends up unused. After collecting the results, share the\ndata—the positives and negatives—with everyone. Doing this shows\ntransparency and makes your colleagues develop a positive attitude toward\nfuture requests for feedback.\n* *Get everyone involved*: Engage employees, managers, and leaders in\ndiscussing and analyzing the feedback findings. Doing this helps to build\ntrust and develop actionable ideas to move the organization forward.\n* *Identify the key issues*: From the discussions and analysis, identify the key\nissues and understand how they would impact the organization, once\naddressed.\n* *Define and act on the next steps*: The purpose of collecting feedback would\nbe pointless if the next steps aren't defined. Real improvement comes\nfrom knowing and working on the next steps.""]",0.999999999975,1.0

"What two forces influence alertness during an all-nighter, and how do they interact?","The two forces influencing alertness during an all-nighter are sleep pressure and the circadian rhythm. Sleep pressure increases with the duration of wakefulness, making you feel sleepier, while the circadian rhythm operates independently and can lead to increased alertness after a low point in the early morning, regardless of sleep pressure.","[""### All-nighters  \nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""
 ""## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure  \nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.  \nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects  \nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:  \n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\nthe ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\nsleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.'
 ""## The circadian rhythm  \nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.  \nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:  \n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\nsuggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\ntimezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\npopulation.  \nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:  \n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\nsleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\nfunction optimally at this time of day.""
 '### Caffeine  \nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively\ninactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.  \nLevels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is\nproblematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes\nbetween five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration\nfrom your body.  \nAn enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.  \nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to\nfunction and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.  \nFor the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on\nbuilding up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging\nchemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.\nOnce your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you\nare hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before\nyou drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated\nin the hours in between.']",0.999999999975,1.0

What's the brain mechanism behind mixing fun and necessary tasks to boost motivation?,"The brain mechanism behind mixing fun and necessary tasks to boost motivation involves the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a central role in motivation, learning, and anticipation of rewards. By making a habit more attractive, it releases more dopamine, which increases motivation to carry it through.","['# Why are habits interesting  \nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.  \nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.  \nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Habits reduce the cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so they can be carried on with your nonconscious mind and you can allocate your attention to other tasks.'
 ""## Working with the habit cravings  \n### Temptation bundling  \nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving. For years we assumed that it was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.  \nHabits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action.  \nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through.  \nTemptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time. In the end you may even look forward to do the habit you need as it's related to the habit you want.""
 ""### Minimize the context switches  \nEach time we switch from one action to another, the brain needs to load all the\nnecessary information to be able to address the new action. Dumping the old one's\ninformation and loading the new is both time consuming and exhausting, so do it\nconsciously and sparingly.  \nOne way of improving this behaviour is by using the [Pomodoro\ntechnique](life_planning.md).""
 '### Habit stacking  \nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.'

What drives employees to prefer anonymous feedback in low-trust settings?,"Employees may prefer anonymous feedback in low-trust settings due to several factors: fear of being judged, fear of losing their job, fear of being singled out, feelings of insecurity, distrust in open-door internal policies, and not knowing the internal processes of the organization. These fears and insecurities create an environment where employees feel safer providing feedback anonymously rather than publicly.","[""shows](https://slack.com/intl/en-ng/blog/transformation/trust-tools-and-teamwork-what-workers-want),\n55 percent of business owners described their organization as very transparent,\nbut only 18 percent of their employees would agree.  \nFor all these reasons, some employees may remain silent when asked for direct\nfeedback, to speak up against an internal issue or in need to report\na colleague or manager. These factors are further amplified if:  \n* The person belongs to a minority group inside the organization.\n* The greater the difference in position between the talking parties. It's more\ndifficult to talk to the CEO than to the immediate manager.  \nUntil the safe space is built where direct feedback is viable, anonymous\nfeedback gives these employees a mechanism to raise their concerns, practice their\nfeedback-giving skills, test the waters, and understand how people perceive\ntheir constructive (and sometimes critical) opinions, thus building the needed\ntrust.""
 ""# Why would you need anonymous feedback?  \nIdeally, everyone in your company should be able to give feedback publicly and\nnot anonymously. They should share constructive criticism and not shy away from\ndirect feedback if they believe and trust that their opinions will be heard and\naddressed.  \nHowever, to achieve this ideal, people need to feel that they are in a [safe\nspace](https://www.lexico.com/definition/safe_space), a place or environment in\nwhich they feel confident that they will not be exposed to discrimination,\ncriticism, harassment, or any other emotional or physical harm. The work place\nis usually not considered a safe space by the employees because they may:  \n* *Fear of being judged*: We want people to like us and not just in our\npersonal lives, but in our professional lives as well. It also seems to bear\na bigger importance that our supervisor likes us because he holds the power\nover our career and financial security. So we live in a constant state of\nanxiety of what might happen if our manager doesn't like us.  \n* *Fear of losing their job*: It’s a form of self-preservation, abstaining from\nsaying something that may be perceived as wrong to someone in a position of\nauthority.  \n* *Fear of being singled out*: Giving direct feedback puts you in the spotlight.\nBeing highlighted against the rest of the employees might be seen as\na threat, especially by people belonging to a different race, gender,\nnational origin, or other identities than most of their coworkers.  \n* *Feel insecure*: People may distrust their colleagues, because they\njust arrived at the organization or may have negative past experiences either with\nthem or with similar people. They may not have a solid stance on an issue,\nbe shy or have problems of self esteem.  \n* *Distrust the open-door internal policies*: Past experiences in other\ncompanies may lead the employee not to trust open-doors policies until they\nhave seen them in practice.  \n* *Not knowing the internal processes of the organization*: As a [Slack study""

However, when feedback\nis collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus\nentirely on the feedback.  \n* *It encourages new employees to share their opinions*:\n[Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0893318905279191)\nhas shown that new employees, who happen to be less senior or influential,\nsee anonymous feedback as more appropriate for formal and informal\nevaluations than their older colleagues. Typically, the last thing a new\nemployee wants is to start on the wrong foot, so they maintain a neutral\nstance. Using anonymous feedback can make new employees feel\nmore comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues.  \nCons of Anonymous Feedback:  \n* *It can breed hostility*: According to this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely),\nanonymity often sets off a “witch hunt”, where leaders seek to know the\nsource of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind\nanonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or\nleaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as\na personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their\nemployees.  \n* *It can be less impactful than attributed feedback*: When using attributed\nfeedback where responses carry the employees’ names, information can be\nanalyzed for relevance and impact. However, with anonymous feedback, it can\nbe difficult to analyze information accurately. It is not uncommon for\ncompanies who choose to practice anonymous feedback, to find less specific\nresponses since details may reveal respondents’ identities. Vague feedback\nfrom employees would have less power to influence behaviors or drive change\nin the organization.  \n* *It can be difficult to act on*: Since anonymous feedback is often difficult\nto trace, it can be challenging for the organization to get context or\nfollow up on important issues, especially when a problem is peculiar to an'
 ""# Pros and cons  \nPros of Anonymous Feedback:  \n* *Employees can express themselves freely and provide valuable insights*: On\ntopics that are considered sensitive, you’ll often find employees who are\nafraid to share their opinions. But when employees have the option to use\nanonymous feedback, you will be offering a safe space for them to share\ntheir honest, constructive feedback about sensitive workplace issues,\nwithout fear of being judged, victimized, radicalized or labelled in any\nway.  \nA formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\nsuperficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without\nmentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that\nno one talks about because they know they are so important that they could\nstir things up.  \nIn fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\nbrought to the table as soon as possible.

For\na manager, that insight is invaluable.  \n* *It builds trust*: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management\nreacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and\nsometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied\nand build up self esteem.  \n* *It offers a sense of security*: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and\ncreates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions.  \n* *It allows every voice to be heard and respected*: In workplaces, where they\npractice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some\nvoices over others.

 '# How to request anonymous feedback  \nWhen requesting for anonymous feedback on an organizational level, it is\nnecessary to:  \n* *Set expectations for employees*: Let your colleagues know how important their\nfeedback is to the organization. Also, assure them that their responses will\nbe non-identifiable (no identifiable names, titles, or other demographic\ndetails). According to a [Harvard Business Review\narticle](https://hbr.org/2002/02/getting-the-truth-into-workplace-surveys),\n“respondents are much more likely to participate if they are confident that\npersonal anonymity is guaranteed.” Set those expectations to increase the\nchances of response from them.\n* *Deploy a feedback platform*: Use a trusted feedback platform to send feedback\nrequests to the rest of the employees.']",0.99999999998,1.0
"What issues come from focusing on results over processes in problem-solving, especially with temporary fixes and personal identity?","Focusing on results over processes in problem-solving can lead to temporary solutions, as it may cause individuals to overlook the source of the issue. This approach can create an 'either-or' conflict regarding goals, where success is only recognized if the goal is achieved, leading to disappointment if it is not. Additionally, focusing solely on goals can result in feelings of depletion after achieving them, potentially undermining the conditions that contributed to that success. Furthermore, identity change can influence behavior, acting as both a powerful force for self-improvement and a potential curse when it works against an individual.","['- When your hard work is focused on a goal you may feel depleted once you meet it and that could make you loose the condition that made you meet the goal in the first place.  \nResearch has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. This of course is a double-edged sword. Identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, identity change can be a curse.'
 '# Where to focus when changing our habits  \n## Identity focused changes  \nChanging our habits is challenging because we try to change the wrong thing in the wrong way.  \nThere are three levels at which change can occur:  \n- Outcomes: Changing your results. Goals fall under this category: publishing a book, run daily\n- Process: Changing your habits and systems: decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation practice.\n- Identity: Changing your beliefs, assumptions and biases: your world view, your self-image, your judgments.  \nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.  \nThe first path of change is doomed because maintaining behaviours that are incongruent with the self is expensive and will not last. Even if they make rational sense. Thus it\'s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behaviour. On the other hand it\'s easy to find motivation once a habit has changed your identity as you may be proud of it and will be willing to maintain all the habits and systems associated with it. For example: The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.  \nFocusing on outcomes may also bring the next problems:  \n- Focusing on the results may lead you to temporal solutions. If you focus on the source of the issue at hand you may solve it with less effort and get you to a more stable one.\n- Goals create an ""either-or"" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are disappointed. Thus you only get a positive reward if you fulfill a goal. If you instead focus on the process rather than the result, you will be satisfied anytime your system is running.'
 'The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.  \nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.  \nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".  \nUltimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.'
 'Denying reality never works though. It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty.  \nTime management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:  \n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances.\n- Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.'
 '## Changing your identity  \nWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.  \nYour habits and systems are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. The more you repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour. To the point that your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.  \nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.  \nOnce you start the ball rolling things become easier as building habits is a feedback loop. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.  \nThe most practical way to change the identity is to:  \n- [Decide the type of person you want to be](#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)\n- Prove it to yourself with small wins  \nAnother advantage of focusing in what type of person you want to be is that maybe the outcome you wanted to focus on is not the wisest smallest step to achieve your identity change. Thinking on the identity you want to embrace can make you think outside the box.']",0.99999999998,1.0

The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.  \nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))  \n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\nwith both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\nbetween the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\nsnap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\nuntil you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\nthe floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\nside of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\nand down motion.  \nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.  \nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):  \n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove""
