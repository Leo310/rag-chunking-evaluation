What characterizes sleep in terms of reduced sensory activity?,"Sleep is characterized by relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity, and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.","[""e longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel.

On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.\n\n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)\n\nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.\n\nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:\n\n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\n    which to remove.\n\nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.\n\nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your tot""

I feel that out of respect of ourselves and the other's time, we need\nto change that perspective. Most of the times interruptions can wait 20 or 60\nminutes, and many of them can be avoided with better action and time planning.\n\nInterruptions are one of the main flow killers. Not only they\nunexpectedly break your flow, they also add undesired mental load as you are\nwaiting for them to happen, and need to check them often. As we've seen\npreviously, to be productive you need to be [able to focus on an action for 20\nminutes](time_management.md#minimize-the-context-switches) without checking the\ninterruption channels.\n\nFill up your own [interruption analysis\nreport](interruption_management.md#interruption_analysis) and define your\n[action flow](interruption_management.md#action-flow) to manage them.\n\n### Avoid lost time doing nothing\n\nSometimes I catch myself watching at the screen with zero mental""

 ""nagement. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.\n\nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.\n\n#### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture's ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it's scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships.  In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don't get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. \n\n### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn't matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling wa""

Likewise,\nwhenever you're invited to a meeting, value if you need to go. If you don't,\npolitely decline the offer.

 'resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"". \n\nUltimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.\n\n### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou\'ll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it\'s daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can\'t as much as you can\'t tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. \n\n### If you don\'t disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only'
 'trains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they\'re really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it\'s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won\'t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It\'s also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won\'t be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn\'t risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have.  \n\n#### Heal yourself from FOMO\nIn practical terms, a limit-embracing attitude to time means organizing your days with the understanding that you definitely won\'t have time for everything you want to do, or that other people want you to do, and so, at the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing. Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all.

It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis).\n\nGeneral guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing.

It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.\n\nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.\n\nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.\n\nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.\n\nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.\n\nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternati""

And even though none were of\na level high enough to be dangerous, and experts confirm that such bacteria are\nimpossible to completely avoid, you can reduce the risk by:\n\n* Storing the brush in a cupboard or in other room.\n* Putting a lid on your toothbrush\n* Closing the lid on your toilet seat before flushing.\n\n## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\n\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.\n\nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))\n\n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\n    with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\n    between the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion.

However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.\n\nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.\n\nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.\n\n### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:\n\n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste.\n* Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\n    to tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\n    massage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\n    outside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\n    side teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\n    your left side.

This disruption in heart health is linked to other systems through the overall deterioration of health, including the immune system, blood sugar levels, and mental health conditions.","[""creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:\n\n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.\n\nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.\n\nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:\n\n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\n    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\n    timezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\n    population.\n\nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:\n\n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\n    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\n    function optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\n    the following morning, or ev""

Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.\n\n### Am I getting enough sleep?\n\nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt\n\nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.\n\nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.\n\nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.\n\n## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes.

The circadian rhythm determines:\n\n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.\n\nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.\n\nThat reset does not come free.

Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.\n\n### Am I getting enough sleep?\n\nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt\n\nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.\n\nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.\n\nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.\n\n## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.\n\nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids.

Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it\'s time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.\n\nOnce sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain\nand body that it\'s time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of\nthe day\n\n## Sleep pressure\n\nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones. Most people fall to the pressure\nafter twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.\n\n### Caffeine\n\nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy.

 ""ace issues,\n    without fear of being judged, victimized, radicalized or labelled in any\n    way.\n\n    A formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\n    superficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without\n    mentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that\n    no one talks about because they know they are so important that they could\n    stir things up.\n\n    In fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\n    brought to the table as soon as possible. They should be addressed by the\n    entire team before they become a source of unhappiness, conflict and lack of\n    productivity.\n\n    An anonymous feedback instrument gives you real power over those issues\n    because it doesn't matter who brought it up, but that it’s resolved. For\n    a manager, that insight is invaluable.\n\n* *It builds trust*: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management\n    reacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and\n    sometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied\n    and build up self esteem.\n\n* *It offers a sense of security*: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and\n    creates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions.\n\n* *It allows every voice to be heard and respected*: In workplaces, where they\n    practice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some\n    voices over others. Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher\n    authority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention.\n    In such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate\n    attention than those raised by the rest of the group. However, when feedback\n    is collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus\n    entirely on the feedback.\n\n* *It encourages new employees to share their opinions*:\n    [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0893318905279191)\n    has shown that new employees, who happen""

Typically, the last thing a new\n    employee wants is to start on the wrong foot, so they maintain a neutral\n    stance. Using anonymous feedback can make new employees feel\n    more comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues.\n\nCons of Anonymous Feedback:\n\n* *It can breed hostility*: According to this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely),\n    anonymity often sets off a “witch hunt”, where leaders seek to know the\n    source of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind\n    anonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or\n    leaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as\n    a personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their\n    employees.\n\n* *It can be less impactful than attributed feedback*: When using attributed\n    feedback where responses carry the employees’ names, information can be\n    analyzed for relevance and impact. However, with anonymous feedback, it can\n    be difficult to analyze information accurately. It is not uncommon for\n    companies who choose to practice anonymous feedback, to find less specific\n    responses since details may reveal respondents’ identities. Vague feedback\n    from employees would have less power to influence behaviors or drive change\n    in the organization.\n\n* *It can be difficult to act on*: Since anonymous feedback is often difficult\n    to trace, it can be challenging for the organization to get context or\n    follow up on important issues, especially when a problem is peculiar to an\n    individual.\n\n# How to request anonymous feedback\n\nWhen requesting for anonymous fe'
 ""tion or may have negative past experiences either with\n    them or with similar people. They may not have a solid stance on an issue,\n    be shy or have problems of self esteem.\n\n* *Distrust the open-door internal policies*: Past experiences in other\n    companies may lead the employee not to trust open-doors policies until they\n    have seen them in practice.\n\n* *Not knowing the internal processes of the organization*: As a [Slack study\n    shows](https://slack.com/intl/en-ng/blog/transformation/trust-tools-and-teamwork-what-workers-want),\n    55 percent of business owners described their organization as very transparent,\n    but only 18 percent of their employees would agree.\n\nFor all these reasons, some employees may remain silent when asked for direct\nfeedback, to speak up against an internal issue or in need to report\na colleague or manager. These factors are further amplified if:\n\n* The person belongs to a minority group inside the organization.\n* The greater the difference in position between the talking parties. It's more\n    difficult to talk to the CEO than to the immediate manager.\n\nUntil the safe space is built where direct feedback is viable, anonymous\nfeedback gives these employees a mechanism to raise their concerns, practice their\nfeedback-giving skills, test the waters, and understand how people perceive\ntheir constructive (and sometimes critical) opinions, thus building the needed\ntrust.\n\n# Pros and cons\n\nPros of Anonymous Feedback:\n\n* *Employees can express themselves freely and provide valuable insights*: On\n    topics that are considered sensitive, you’ll often find employees who are\n    afraid to share their opinions. But when employees have the option to use\n    anonymous feedback, you will be offering a safe space for them to share\n    their honest, constructive feedback about sensitive workplace issues,\n    without fear of being judged, victimized, radicalized or labelled in any\n    way.\n\n    A formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\n    superficial, non-threateni""
 '](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. \n\n### If you don\'t disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you\'ll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. \n\nReality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you\'ve saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It\'s true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.\n\nIt also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It\'s somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.\n\nDenying reality never works though. It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a p']",0.6388888888675925,1.0
