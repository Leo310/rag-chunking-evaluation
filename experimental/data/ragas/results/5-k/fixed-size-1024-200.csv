What four stages are key for building good habits?,"The four stages key for building good habits are: Cue: Make it obvious, Craving: Make it attractive, Response: Make it easy, Reward: Make it satisfying.","['A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\n\nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.\n\nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself.

And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why.'
 "". The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.\n\nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.\n\nWe chase rewards because they:\n\n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\n\nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.\n\nIf we keep these stages in mind then:\n\n- To build good habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it obvious\n    - Craving: Make it attractive\n    - Response: Make it easy\n    - Reward: Make it satisfying\n\n- To break bad habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it invisible""

 'A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\n\nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.\n\nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself.

Which hormone from the pineal gland helps regulate sleep for morning vs. evening types?,"The hormone that helps regulate sleep for morning vs. evening types is melatonin, which is released into the bloodstream from the pineal gland.","[""![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)\n\nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.\n\nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.\n\nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.\n\nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine.

Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it's time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.\n\nOnce sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin.

The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay.

How do cues affect cravings and habits?,"Cues affect cravings and habits by serving as visual triggers that draw your attention towards the desired habit. When environmental cues reappear, the urge to act on the encoded habit follows, which can lead to a reinforcement of both good and bad habits.

By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.\n\nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work.

This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. \n\nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.\n\nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit.

You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".\n\n## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why.'

The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".\n\nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. \n\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.\n\nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.\n\n### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour.
