What defines sleep as a naturally recurring state of mind and body?,"Sleep is defined as a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity, and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, along with reduced interactions with surroundings. It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli.","['Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical\ndecisions and choices.

What's the mindset for seeing time as flow?,"The mindset for seeing time as flow involves living in deep time, where one experiences a heightened awareness of the vividness of things and a feeling of timelessness. This perspective contrasts with the modern view of time as a resource to be spent and emphasizes organic life rhythms rather than imposed schedules.","['a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.'
 'Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.'
 'Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.'

"How does repeating behaviors in the same context boost habit automaticity, and what does this mean for managing habits?","When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action, which increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. This means that the more often a behavior is performed in the same context, the more automatic it becomes, characterized by features such as efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. For managing habits, this implies that consistently practicing behaviors in the same environment can help in forming new habits and making them automatic over time.","['When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.'
 'As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.'
 ""When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.""
 ""A new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.""

How do circadian rhythm and sleep debt affect morning alertness?,"The circadian rhythm affects morning alertness by causing a low point in alertness around five or six in the morning, after which you start to feel more awake.

"How does interdental cleaning help prevent dental issues, given that brushes miss some plaque?","Interdental cleaning helps prevent dental issues because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.
