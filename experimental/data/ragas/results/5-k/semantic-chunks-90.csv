What role does self-discipline play in the pursuit of effective time management?,"Self-discipline plays a crucial role in the pursuit of effective time management, as it is necessary to follow the right time management system and build the right habits to improve efficiency.","['Using time effectively gives the person ""choice"" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency. To be able to do time management, you first need to define how do you want to increase your effectiveness and efficiency. For me, it means increasing the amount and quality of actions per unit of time or effort.'
 ""That's a tainted way of thinking about your personal time.""
 'This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel.'
 'Assumptions that led\nthem astray are identified and their origins explored.'
 'As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. Making time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face. The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable. Soon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed. The fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"". Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead. ### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou\'ll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it\'s daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can\'t as much as you can\'t tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. ### If you don\'t disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you\'ll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. Reality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you\'ve saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It\'s true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.']",0.699999999965,1.0

"How are concentration, control, and flow linked in Pilates?","Concentration, control, and flow in Pilates are linked through the need for intense focus on body awareness and movement precision. Concentration is essential for controlling muscles against resistance, while flow is achieved by creating smooth transitions between exercises once precision is mastered. This interconnectedness helps build strength and stamina.","[""Pilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of\ndifficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of\nthe instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations. Intensity\ncan be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises. You can think of yoga, but without the spiritual aspects. # [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n\n## Breathing\n\nThe breathing in Pilates is meant the to be deeper, with full inhalations and\ncomplete exhalations. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up. When\ninhaling you need to maintain this engagement to keep the core in control. The difficult part comes when you try to properly coordinate this\nbreathing practice with the exercise movement, breathes out with the\neffort and in on the return. This technique is important as it increases the intake of oxygen and the circulation\nof this oxygenated blood to every part of the body, cleaning and\ninvigorating it. ## Concentration\n\nIt demands intense focus, as you need to be aware of the position of each part\nof your body, and how they move to precisely do the exercise. ## Control\n\nYou don't see many quick movements, most of the exercises are anaerobic. The\ndifficult relies on controlling your muscles to do what you want them to while\nthey fight against gravity, springs and other torture tools. ## Flow\n\nPilates aims for elegant economy of movement, creating flow through the use of\nappropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are\nintended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and\nstamina. A smoothly doing a roll down (from seated position with your legs straight, slowly lay\ndown, vertebrae by vertebrae) is a difficult challenge, as you need every muscle\nto coordinate to share the load of the weight. The muscles that we use more are\nstronger, and some of them are barely used, Pilates positions and slow\ntransitions force you to use those weak, forgotten muscles, and when the load is\ntransferred from the strong to the weak, your body starts shaking or breaks the\nmovement rate thus breaking the flow.""

What's the best brushing routine for gum health?,"The best brushing routine for gum health is to brush for a minimum of two minutes, at least twice a day, and ideally after each meal. This routine helps in maintaining oral hygiene and can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums.","[""Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle. When using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes. Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood. ### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly.""
 ""If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities. So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal. Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin. For maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay. At night, you produce less saliva than during the day.""
 ""* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums. When you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier. If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly. ## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth. [[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]\n\nChoose a different time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch. And remember not\nto eat or drink for 30 minutes after using a fluoride mouthwash. ## Do yearly check ups\n\nFirst find a dentist that you trust, until you do, search for second and third\noptions before diving into anything you may regret.

 'This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur. ## Teeth brushing\n\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).

The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:\n\n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\n    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\n    function optimally at this time of day. * *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\n    the following morning, or even in the afternoon. * *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\n    leaning towards eveningness. ### Melatonin\n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night\nto your brain and body by releasing\n[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from\nthe pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it\'s time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself. Once sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain\nand body that it\'s time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of\nthe day\n\n## Sleep pressure\n\nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones.'
