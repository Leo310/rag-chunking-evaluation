What is the significance of chaining small habits in the process of habit stacking?,"The significance of chaining small habits in the process of habit stacking is that once you have mastered the basic structure of tying a new habit to an established one, you can create larger stacks by linking multiple small habits together. This allows for the development of more complex routines based on existing behaviors.","['### Habit stacking  \nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.'
 ""A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.  \nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.  \nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.  \nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.""
 ""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""

What are the consequences of treating time as a resource?,"The consequences of treating time as a resource include feeling pressure to use it efficiently, leading to self-beratement for perceived waste. This mindset can bind one's sense of self-worth to time management, making it difficult to simply live in the moment. It creates a rigged game where one never feels they are doing well enough, causing a focus on future goals rather than present experiences. Ultimately, it can lead to a life spent worrying about the future and makes it hard to experience the flow of life.","['The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.  \nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.  \nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".  \nUltimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.'
 ""### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou'll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it's daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can't as much as you can't tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can.""
 '### Time is not a resource to spend  \nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.  \nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.  \nThere\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented.  \nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.'
 ""### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won't ever completely go away, we're even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are.  \nTime pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.  \nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.""
 '# Anticapitalist approach to time management\nTime management is being used to perpetrate the now hegemonic capitalist values. Its a pity because the underlying concepts are pretty useful and interesting but they are oriented towards improving productivity and being able to deal with an increasing amount of work. Basically they\'re always telling you to be a better cog. It doesn\'t matter how good you are, there is always room for improvement. I\'ve fallen on this trap for a long time (I\'m still getting my head out of the hole) and I\'m trying to amend things by applying the concepts on an anticapitalist mindset. The turning point was to read [Four thousand weeks: Time management for mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), the article will have book extracts mixed with my way of thinking.  \nSome (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person. You need to be at a certain level of the social ladder to even start thinking in these terms. And depending on the number of oppressions you\'re suffering you\'ll have more or less room to maneuver. That margin is completely outside our control so by no means we should feel guilty of not being able to manage time. What follows are just guidelines to deal with this time anxiety imposed by the capitalist system with whatever air we have to breath.']",0.99999999998,1.0

 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".'
 ""Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source.

 ""## Sleeping time and sense distortions  \nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.  \nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.  \nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.""
 ""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from""
 ""## The circadian rhythm  \nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it.

This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""
 ""## Working with the habit cues  \nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We'll do it by:  \n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)""
 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".'
 '### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change  \nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"".  \nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.  \nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.'
 ""Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.""]",0.99999999998,1.0
"What brain activity in REM resembles wakefulness, and how does it show info processing in different regions?","Brainwave activity of REM sleep resembles that of wakefulness, cycling at a fast frequency of thirty or forty times per second in an unreliable pattern.

They cycle (going up and down) at a fast frequency of thirty or forty\ntimes per second in an unreliable pattern. This behaviour is explained by the\nfact that different parts of your waking brain are processing different pieces\nof information at different moments in time and in different ways.  \n![ ](brainwaves.jpg)""
 ""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from""
 ""and the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.  \nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.""
 ""## Sleeping time and sense distortions  \nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.  \nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.  \nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.""

How to manage tasks amid interruptions?,"To manage tasks amid interruptions, it is recommended to minimize context switches and focus on fewer processes, ideally less than three.

 ""### Meetings  \nCalls, video calls, group calls or physical meetings are the best communication\nchannel to transmit non trivial short messages. Even if they are the most\nefficient, they will break your focus, as you'll need to prepare\nyourself to know what to say and how, go to the meeting location, and then\nprocess all the information gathered. That's why if not used wisely, it can be\na sink of efficiency.  \nTry to minimize and group the meetings, thus having less interruptions. Maximize\nthe continuous uninterrupted time, so schedule them at the start or end of the\nmorning or afternoon.  \nOnce you agreed to attend, make each of them count. Define an agenda and a time\nlimit per section. That'll keep the conversation on track, and will give enough\ninformation to the attendees to decide if they need to be there. Likewise,\nwhenever you're invited to a meeting, value if you need to go. If you don't,\npolitely decline the offer. Sometimes assigning someone the role to conduct the\nmeeting, or taking turns to talk can help.  \nThere are more informal meetings where you don't need all these constrains and\nformality. For example in a coffee break. You know that they are going to be\nunproductive but that's ok too. Master your tools and apply them where you think\nthey are needed.""
 ""### Minimize the context switches  \nEach time we switch from one action to another, the brain needs to load all the\nnecessary information to be able to address the new action.

 ""### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won't ever completely go away, we're even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are.  \nTime pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.  \nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.""]",0.7499999999625,0.3333333333333333
