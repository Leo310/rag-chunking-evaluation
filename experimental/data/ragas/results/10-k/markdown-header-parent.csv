What techniques are recommended for effective plaque removal using a manual toothbrush?,"For effective plaque removal using a manual toothbrush, it is recommended to use a toothbrush with a small head and soft bristles, and to employ a systematic approach rather than back and forth brushing, as this is not effective at the gum line.","['# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### Manual versus electric tooth brush\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.  \nThe technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle.  \nWhen using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles.  \n[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.  \nRegardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.'
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).  \nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.  \nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.  \nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.  \nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.  \nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.  \nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.  \nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.  \nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight.

 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.  \nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))  \n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\nwith both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\nbetween the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\nsnap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\nuntil you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\nthe floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\nside of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\nand down motion.  \nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.  \nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):  \n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.\n* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.  \nWhen you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier.  If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly.""
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### How to brush your teeth\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:  \n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste.\n* Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\nto tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\nmassage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\noutside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\nside teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\nyour left side. Try to avoid brushing with too much force as this can\ndamage the surface of your teeth.\n* Rinse with water.\n* Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and repeat the cycle.\n* Brush your tongue.\n* Spit the extra toothpaste but don't rinse or drink anything in the next 30\nminutes.  \nThe whole process should take at least two minutes.""

([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))  \nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:  \n* You’ll get rid of the excess toothpaste along with any food or bacteria that\ncould have been stuck in your teeth or released by the brushing itself.\n* You’ll also be removing the fluoride from your mouth, which if swallowed,\nmight upset your stomach.  \nPeople against rinsing your mouth argue that:  \n* When you rinse with water, you’re potentially washing away any remnants of\ntoothpaste, including the fluoride that makes it work. That could mean that\neven though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\nshould be.  \nWhilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other. So it's up to\nyou to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  \nSome people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush.  Similarly, if you consume a lot of sugar, you should\nprobably avoid rinsing. If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference.""
 '# How to take care of your teeth\n??? note ""TL;DR: Daily actions to keep your teeth healty""\n* [Brush your teeth](#how-to-brush-your-teeth) after every meal for at least two minutes.\n* [Floss each day](#how-to-floss) before the last teeth brush.\n* Use an [electric toothbrush](#manual-versus-electric-tooth-brush).\n* [Replace the brush](#toothbrush-replacement) each three months or at first\nsign of wear and tear.\n* Don\'t eat or drink anything but water after your nightly brush.\n* [Do not rinse after you brush your teeth](#to-rinse-or-not-to-rinse).\n* [Use floss instead of a toothpick](#how-to-floss).\n* [Use mouthwash daily but not after brushing](#mouth-washing).  \nOral hygiene is the practice of keeping one\'s mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis).  \nGeneral guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.  \nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.'
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.  \nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))  \n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\nwith both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\nbetween the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\nsnap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\nuntil you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\nthe floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\nside of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\nand down motion.  \nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.  \nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):  \n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.\n* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.  \nWhen you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier.  If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly.""

 '# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### Manual versus electric tooth brush\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.  \nThe technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle.  \nWhen using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles.  \n[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.  \nRegardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.'

How do adenosine levels and circadian rhythm affect alertness post sleep deprivation?,"Adenosine levels continue to rise when you remain awake, which typically would make you feel sleepier. However, despite feeling increasingly sleepy throughout the night, alertness begins to improve after hitting a low point around five or six in the morning due to the energy return of the circadian rhythm, which operates independently of sleep pressure.","[""# Sleep physiological effects\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.  \nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\n### Am I getting enough sleep?\nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt  \nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.  \nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.  \nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects\n## Sleep pressure\n### Caffeine\nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively\ninactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.  \nLevels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is\nproblematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes\nbetween five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration\nfrom your body.  \nAn enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.  \nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to\nfunction and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.  \nFor the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on\nbuilding up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging\nchemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.\nOnce your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you\nare hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before\nyou drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated\nin the hours in between.'

 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## The circadian rhythm\nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.  \nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:  \n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\nsuggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\ntimezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\npopulation.  \nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:  \n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\nsleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\nfunction optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\nthe following morning, or even in the afternoon.\n* *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\nleaning towards eveningness.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects\n## Sleep pressure\nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones. Most people fall to the pressure\nafter twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.'
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## The circadian rhythm\n### Melatonin\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night\nto your brain and body by releasing\n[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from\nthe pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it's time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.  \nOnce sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain\nand body that it's time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of\nthe day""
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## The sleep cycle\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.  \nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects\nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:  \n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\nthe ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\nsleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.'
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## Sleeping time and sense distortions\nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.  \nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.  \nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.""]",0.9999999999888889,1.0

It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis).  \nGeneral guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.  \nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.'
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).  \nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.  \nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.  \nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.  \nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.  \nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.  \nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.  \nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.  \nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.""
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### To rinse or not to rinse\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth. ([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))  \nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:  \n* You’ll get rid of the excess toothpaste along with any food or bacteria that\ncould have been stuck in your teeth or released by the brushing itself.\n* You’ll also be removing the fluoride from your mouth, which if swallowed,\nmight upset your stomach.  \nPeople against rinsing your mouth argue that:  \n* When you rinse with water, you’re potentially washing away any remnants of\ntoothpaste, including the fluoride that makes it work. That could mean that\neven though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\nshould be.  \nWhilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other. So it's up to\nyou to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  \nSome people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush.  Similarly, if you consume a lot of sugar, you should\nprobably avoid rinsing. If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference.""
 '# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### Manual versus electric tooth brush\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.  \nThe technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle.  \nWhen using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles.  \n[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.  \nRegardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.'
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### Toothbrush replacement\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility.\n[1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)  \nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush.""
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.  \nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))  \n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\nwith both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\nbetween the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\nsnap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\nuntil you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\nthe floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\nside of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\nand down motion.  \nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.  \nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):  \n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.\n* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.  \nWhen you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier.  If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly.""
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### How to brush your teeth\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:  \n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste.\n* Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\nto tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\nmassage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\noutside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\nside teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\nyour left side. Try to avoid brushing with too much force as this can\ndamage the surface of your teeth.\n* Rinse with water.\n* Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and repeat the cycle.\n* Brush your tongue.\n* Spit the extra toothpaste but don't rinse or drink anything in the next 30\nminutes.  \nThe whole process should take at least two minutes.""

This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.  \nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.""
 '# How to change a habit\n## Working with the habit cues\n### Habit stacking\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.'
 '# How to change a habit\n## Select which habits you want to work with\nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".'
 ""# How to change a habit\nThe process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:  \n- **Reward** is the end goal.\n- **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour. It's contains the information that predicts a reward.\n- **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act.\n- **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.  \nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.  \nWe chase rewards because they:  \n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.  \nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.  \nIf we keep these stages in mind then:  \n- To build good habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it obvious\n- Craving: Make it attractive\n- Response: Make it easy\n- Reward: Make it satisfying  \n- To break bad habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it invisible\n- Craving: Make it unattractive\n- Response: Make it difficult\n- Reward: Make it unsatisfying""

 ""# How to change a habit\n## Working with the habit cravings\n### Temptation bundling\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving. For years we assumed that it was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.  \nHabits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action.  \nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through.  \nTemptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time. In the end you may even look forward to do the habit you need as it's related to the habit you want.""
 ""A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.  \nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.  \nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.  \nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.""

 ""# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n## Flow\nPilates aims for elegant economy of movement, creating flow through the use of\nappropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are\nintended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and\nstamina.  \nA smoothly doing a roll down (from seated position with your legs straight, slowly lay\ndown, vertebrae by vertebrae) is a difficult challenge, as you need every muscle\nto coordinate to share the load of the weight. The muscles that we use more are\nstronger, and some of them are barely used, Pilates positions and slow\ntransitions force you to use those weak, forgotten muscles, and when the load is\ntransferred from the strong to the weak, your body starts shaking or breaks the\nmovement rate thus breaking the flow.  \nEven though it looks silly, it's tough.""

 '# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n## Breathing\nThe breathing in Pilates is meant the to be deeper, with full inhalations and\ncomplete exhalations. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up. When\ninhaling you need to maintain this engagement to keep the core in control.  \nThe difficult part comes when you try to properly coordinate this\nbreathing practice with the exercise movement, breathes out with the\neffort and in on the return.  \nThis technique is important as it increases the intake of oxygen and the circulation\nof this oxygenated blood to every part of the body, cleaning and\ninvigorating it.'
