What is the role of the scrum master during the sprint retrospective?,"The scrum master conducts the sprint retrospective, which consists of five phases: setting the stage, gathering data, and others.","['The most impactful\nimprovements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the\nbacklog for the next sprint. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the sprint\nretrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and\nadaptation. The sprint retrospective concludes the sprint. The meeting consists of five phases, all of them conducted by the scrum master:\n\n* *Set the stage*: There is an opening dynamic to give people time to “arrive”\n    and get into the right mood. * *Gather Data*: Help everyone remember.'
 ""* Status of uncompleted tasks, and reason why they weren't complete. * The meaning of the work done in terms of the semester OKRs. * Create the report of the proposed next sprint's planning, with\n            arguments behind why we do each task. * Update the planning with the requirements of the stakeholders. * Upload the review reports to the documentation repository. * Arrange, prepare and conduct the refinement meetings:\n    * Prepare the tasks that need to be refined:\n        * Adjust the priority of the backlog tasks. * Select the tasks that are most probably going to enter the next\n            sprint. * Expand the description of those tasks so it's understandable by any\n            team member. * If the task need some steps to be done before it can be worked upon,\n            do them or create a task to do them before the original task. * Create the required refinement calendar events inviting the members of the\n        scrum team. * Conduct the refinement meeting. * Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting. * Prepare the next sprint's Kanban board. * Arrange, prepare and conduct the retro meeting:\n    * Prepare the dynamics of the meeting. * Create the retro calendar event inviting the members of the scrum team. * Conduct the retro meeting. * Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting. * Upload the retro reports to the documentation repository. * Arrange, prepare and conduct the planning meeting:\n    * Make sure that you've done the required refinement sessions to have the\n        tasks and Kanban board ready for the next sprint. * Create the planning calendar event inviting the members of the scrum team. * Conduct the planning meeting. * Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting and start the sprint. ## Developer\n\nDevelopers are the people in the scrum team that are committed to creating any\naspect of a usable increment each sprint. It's roles are:\n\n* Attend the daily, refinement, review, retro and planning meetings. * Focus on completing the assigned sprint tasks. * Do the required work or be responsible to coordinate the work that others\n        do for the task to be complete. * Make sure that the [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done) is met\n        before closing the task. # Inter team workflow\n\nTo improve the communication between the teams, you can:\n\n* Present more clearly the team objectives and reasons behind our tasks, and\n    make the rest of the teams part of the decision making. * Be aware of the other team's needs and tasks. To solve the first point, you can offer the rest of the teams different\nsolutions depending the time they want to invest in staying informed:\n\n* You can invite the other team members to the sprint reviews, where you show the\n    sprint's work and present what you plan to do in the next sprint. This could\n    be the best way to stay informed, as you'll try to sum up everything they\n    need to know in the shortest time. * For those that want to be more involved with the decision making inside the\n    team, they could be invited to the planning sessions and even the\n    refinement ones where they are involved. * For those that don't want to attend the review, they can either get a summary\n    from other members of their team that did attend, or they can read the\n    meeting notes that you publish after each one. The second point means that your team members become more involved in the\nother team's work. The different levels of involvement are linked to the amount\nof time invested and the quality of the interaction. The highest level of involvement would be that a member of your team is\nalso part of the other team. This is easier for those teams that already use\nScrum as their agile framework, that means:\n\n* Attending the team's meetings (retro, review, planning and refinement). * Inform the rest of your team of the outcomes of those meetings in the\n    daily meeting. * Focus on doing that team's sprint tasks. * Populate and refine the tasks related to your team in the other team issue\n    tracker. For those teams that are smaller or don't use Scrum as their agile framework,\na your team members could accompany them by:\n\n* Setting periodic meetings (weekly/biweekly/monthly) to discuss what are they\n    doing, what do they plan to do and how.""

The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Analyze and draft a plan to iteratively improve the team's well-being, quality\n    and efficiency. ## Review meetings\n\nReviews are the meetings where the product owner presents the sprint work to the\nrest of the team and the stakeholders. The idea of what is going to be done in\nthe next sprint is also defined in this meeting. The meeting goes as follows:\n\n* The product owner explains what items have been “Done” and what has not been\n    “Done”. * The product owner discuss what went well during the sprint, what problems they\n    ran into, and how those problems were solved. * The developers demonstrate the work that it has “Done” and answers questions. * The product owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands in terms of the\n    semester OKRs. * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review\n    provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning. As the target audience are the stakeholders, the language must be changed\naccordingly, we should give overall ideas and not get caught in complicated high\ntech detailed explanations unless they ask them. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Increase the transparency on what the team has done in the sprint. By\n    explaining to the stake holders:\n\n    * What has been done. * The reasons why we've implemented the specific outcomes for the tasks. * The deviation from the expected plan of action. * The status of the unfinished tasks with an explanation of why weren't they\n        closed. * The meaning of the work done in terms of the semester OKRs. * Increase the transparency on what the team plans to do for the following\n    sprint by explaining to the stakeholders:\n\n    * What do we plan to do in the next semester. * How we plan to do it. * The meaning of the plan in terms of the semester OKRs. * Get the feedback from the stakeholders. We expect to gather and process their\n    feedback by processing their opinions both of the work done of the past\n    sprint and the work to be done in the next one. It will be gathered by the\n    scrum master and persisted in the board on the planning meetings. * Incorporate the stakeholders in the decision making process of the team. By\n    inviting them to define with the rest of the scrum team the tasks for the\n    next sprint. ## Planning meetings\n\nPlannings are the meetings where the scrum team decides what it's going to do in\nthe following sprint. The decision is made with the information gathered in the\nrefinement, retro and review sessions. Conducted by the scrum master, usually only the members of the scrum team\n(developers, product owner and scrum master) are present, but stakeholders can\nalso be invited. If the job has been done in the previous sessions, the backlog should be\npriorized and refined, so we should only add the newest issues gathered in the\nretro and review, refine them and decide what we want to do this sprint. The meeting goes as follows:\n\n* We add the issues raised in the review to the backlog. * We analyze the tasks on the top of the backlog, add them to the sprint\n    board without assigning it to any developer. * Once all tasks are added, we the stats of past sprints to see if the scope is\n    realistic. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Assert that the tasks added to the sprint follow the global path defined by\n    the semester OKRs. * All team has a clear view of what needs to be done.""
 ""---\ntitle: Scrum\ndate: 20210302\nauthor: Lyz\n---\n\n[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an\n[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for\ndeveloping, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial\nemphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such\nas personal task management. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,\nwho break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed\niterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two\nweeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,\ncalled daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to\ndemonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and\na sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks. For my personal scrum workflow and in the DevOps and DevSecOps teams I've found\nthat Sprint goals are not operative, as multiple unrelated tasks need to\nbe done, so it doesn't make sense to define just one goal. # The meetings\n\nScrum tries to minimize the time spent in meetings while keeping a clearly\ndefined direction and a healthy environment between all the people involved in\nthe project. To achieve that is uses four types of meetings:\n\n* [Daily](#daily-meetings). * [Refinement](#refinement-meetings). * [Retros](#retro-meetings). * [Reviews](#review-meetings). * [Plannings](#planning-meetings). ## Daily meetings\n\nDailies or weeklies are the meetings where the development team exposes at high level of\ndetail the current work. Similar to the dailies in the scrum terms, in the\nmeeting each development team member exposes:\n\n* The advances in the assigned tasks, with special interest in the encountered\n    problems and deviations from the steps defined in the refinement. * An estimation of the tasks that are going to be left unfinished by the end of\n    the sprint. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Get a general knowledge of what everyone else is doing. * Learn from the experience gained by the others while doing their tasks. * Get a clear idea of where we stand in terms of completing the sprint tasks. As opposed to what it may seem, this meeting is not meant to keep track of the\nproductivity of each of us, we work based on trust, and know that each of us is\nworking our best. ## Refinement meetings\n\nRefinement are the meetings where the development team reviews the issues in the\nbacklog and prepares the tasks that will probably be done in the following\nsprint. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Next sprint tasks are ready to be worked upon in the next sprint. That means\n    each task:\n    * Meets the Definition of Ready. * All disambiguation in task description, validation criteria and steps\n        is solved. * Make the Planning meeting more dynamic. The meeting is composed of the following phases:\n\n* Scrum master preparation. * Development team refinement. * Product owner refinement. ### Refinement preparation\n\nTo prepare the refinement, the scrum master has to:\n\n* Make a copy of the [Refinement document template](refinement_template.md). * Open the OKRs document if you have one and for category in OKR categories:\n  * Select the category label in the issue tracker and select the milestone of\n      the semester. * Review which of those issues might enter the next sprint, and set the sprint\n      project on them. * Remove the milestone from the issue filter to see if there are interesting\n      issues without the milestone set. * Go to the next sprint Kanban board:\n  * Order the issues by priority. * Make sure there are tasks with the `Good first issue` label. * Make sure that there are more tasks than we can probably do so we can remove\n      some instead of need to review the backlog and add more in the\n      refinement. * Fill up the sprint goals section of the refinement document. * Create the Refinement developer team and product owner meeting calendar\n    events. ### Development team refinement meeting\n\nIn this meeting the development team with the help of the scrum master, reviews\nthe tasks to be added to the next sprint. The steps are defined in the\nrefinement template. ### Product owner refinement meeting\n\nIn this meeting the product owner with the help of the scrum master reviews\nthe tasks to be added to the next sprint. With the refinement document as\nreference:\n\n* The expected current sprint undone tasks are reviewed. * The sprint goals are discussed, modified and agreed. If there are many\n    changes, we might think of setting the goals together in next sprints. * The scrum master does a quick description of each issue. * Each task priority is discussed and updated. ## Retro meetings\n\nRetrospectives or Retros are the meetings where the scrum team plan ways to\nincrease the quality and effectiveness of the team. The scrum master conducts different dynamics to help the rest of the scrum team\ninspect how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions,\nprocesses, tools, and their Definition of Done and Ready.""

It's somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.

 ""In fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\n    brought to the table as soon as possible. They should be addressed by the\n    entire team before they become a source of unhappiness, conflict and lack of\n    productivity. An anonymous feedback instrument gives you real power over those issues\n    because it doesn't matter who brought it up, but that it’s resolved. For\n    a manager, that insight is invaluable. * *It builds trust*: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management\n    reacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and\n    sometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied\n    and build up self esteem. * *It offers a sense of security*: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and\n    creates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions. * *It allows every voice to be heard and respected*: In workplaces, where they\n    practice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some\n    voices over others. Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher\n    authority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention. In such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate\n    attention than those raised by the rest of the group. However, when feedback\n    is collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus\n    entirely on the feedback. * *It encourages new employees to share their opinions*:\n    [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0893318905279191)\n    has shown that new employees, who happen to be less senior or influential,\n    see anonymous feedback as more appropriate for formal and informal\n    evaluations than their older colleagues. Typically, the last thing a new\n    employee wants is to start on the wrong foot, so they maintain a neutral\n    stance. Using anonymous feedback can make new employees feel\n    more comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues. Cons of Anonymous Feedback:\n\n* *It can breed hostility*: According to this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely),\n    anonymity often sets off a “witch hunt”, where leaders seek to know the\n    source of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind\n    anonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or\n    leaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as\n    a personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their\n    employees. * *It can be less impactful than attributed feedback*: When using attributed\n    feedback where responses carry the employees’ names, information can be\n    analyzed for relevance and impact. However, with anonymous feedback, it can\n    be difficult to analyze information accurately. It is not uncommon for\n    companies who choose to practice anonymous feedback, to find less specific\n    responses since details may reveal respondents’ identities. Vague feedback\n    from employees would have less power to influence behaviors or drive change\n    in the organization. * *It can be difficult to act on*: Since anonymous feedback is often difficult\n    to trace, it can be challenging for the organization to get context or\n    follow up on important issues, especially when a problem is peculiar to an\n    individual. # How to request anonymous feedback\n\nWhen requesting for anonymous feedback on an organizational level, it is\nnecessary to:\n\n* *Set expectations for employees*: Let your colleagues know how important their\n    feedback is to the organization. Also, assure them that their responses will\n    be non-identifiable (no identifiable names, titles, or other demographic\n    details). According to a [Harvard Business Review\n    article](https://hbr.org/2002/02/getting-the-truth-into-workplace-surveys),\n    “respondents are much more likely to participate if they are confident that\n    personal anonymity is guaranteed.” Set those expectations to increase the\n    chances of response from them. * *Deploy a feedback platform*: Use a trusted feedback platform to send feedback\n    requests to the rest of the employees. # How to Act on Anonymous Feedback\n\nOnce you have sent the anonymous feedback, be sure to:\n\n* *Gather and share the findings*: A significant issue with employee feedback is\n    that the data often ends up unused. After collecting the results, share the\n    data—the positives and negatives—with everyone. Doing this shows\n    transparency and makes your colleagues develop a positive attitude toward\n    future requests for feedback. * *Get everyone involved*: Engage employees, managers, and leaders in\n    discussing and analyzing the feedback findings. Doing this helps to build\n    trust and develop actionable ideas to move the organization forward. * *Identify the key issues*: From the discussions and analysis, identify the key\n    issues and understand how they would impact the organization, once\n    addressed. * *Define and act on the next steps*: The purpose of collecting feedback would\n    be pointless if the next steps aren't defined. Real improvement comes\n    from knowing and working on the next steps. # References\n\n* [Osasumwen Arigbe article on Diversity, Inclusion, and Anonymous Feedback](https://inkrement.io/blog/diversity-inclusion-and-anonymous-feedback/)\n* [Paula Clapon article Why anonymous employee feedback is the better alternative](https://gethppy.com/employee-engagement/why-anonymous-employee-feedback-is-the-better-alternative)\n* [Julian Cook article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-reasons-why-anonymous-workplace-feedback-better-julian-cook).

 'It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. Time management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. - Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead. ### Embrace the finitude of time\n\nWe recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we\'ll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don\'t have to consciously participate in what it\'s like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality. Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they\'re really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it\'s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won\'t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It\'s also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won\'t be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn\'t risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have. #### Heal yourself from FOMO\nIn practical terms, a limit-embracing attitude to time means organizing your days with the understanding that you definitely won\'t have time for everything you want to do, or that other people want you to do, and so, at the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing. Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all. It also means resisting the temptation to ""keep your options open"" in favour of deliberately making big, daunting, irreversible commitments, which you can\'t know in advance will turn out for the best, but which reliably prove more fulfilling in the end. And it means standing firm in the face of FOMO (fear of missing out) because you come to realize that missing out on something (indeed on almost everything) is basically guaranteed. Which isn\'t actually a problem anyway, it turns to, because ""missing out"" is what makes your choices meaningful in the first place. Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn\'t, and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you. ### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won\'t ever completely go away, we\'re even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I\'m aware of no other time management technique that\'s half as effective as just facing the way things truly are. Time pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you\'re implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you\'ll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you\'re in. Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history. #### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don\'t get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. ### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead. This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones. Our attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. We live in a constant spirit of joyless urgency. # How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life.

When's best to wait after brushing to keep toothpaste benefits?,"The best time to wait after brushing to keep the benefits of toothpaste is at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking, especially after using a fluoride mouthwash.","[""If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities. So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal. Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin. For maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.

 ""* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums. When you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier. If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly. ## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth. [[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]\n\nChoose a different time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch.

 ""Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle. When using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes. Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood. ### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility. [1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush. ### To rinse or not to rinse\n\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth. ([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))\n\nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:\n\n* You’ll get rid of the excess toothpaste along with any food or bacteria that\n    could have been stuck in your teeth or released by the brushing itself. * You’ll also be removing the fluoride from your mouth, which if swallowed,\n    might upset your stomach. People against rinsing your mouth argue that:\n\n* When you rinse with water, you’re potentially washing away any remnants of\n    toothpaste, including the fluoride that makes it work. That could mean that\n    even though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\n    should be. Whilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other. So it's up to\nyou to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Some people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush. Similarly, if you consume a lot of sugar, you should\nprobably avoid rinsing.""
 ""Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks. That's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work. ### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:\n\n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste. * Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\n    to tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\n    massage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\n    outside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\n    side teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\n    your left side. Try to avoid brushing with too much force as this can\n    damage the surface of your teeth. * Rinse with water. * Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and repeat the cycle. * Brush your tongue. * Spit the extra toothpaste but don't rinse or drink anything in the next 30\n    minutes. The whole process should take at least two minutes. ### Manual versus electric tooth brush\n\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums. The technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention.""
 ""If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference. ### [Keep your brush away from your feces](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAs the [Mythbusters showed](https://mythresults.com/episode12), Fecal coliform\nwere found on toothbrushes stored at the bathroom. And even though none were of\na level high enough to be dangerous, and experts confirm that such bacteria are\nimpossible to completely avoid, you can reduce the risk by:\n\n* Storing the brush in a cupboard or in other room. * Putting a lid on your toothbrush\n* Closing the lid on your toilet seat before flushing. ## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\n\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession. The correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))\n\n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers. * For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\n    with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\n    between the fingers. * Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\n    snap the floss into the gums. * When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\n    until you feel resistance. * Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\n    the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\n    side of the next tooth. * Do not forget the back of your last tooth. * Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\n    and down motion. You should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing. Another [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):\n\n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.""

Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one\'s mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis). General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur. ## Teeth brushing\n\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).

 'It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. Time management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. - Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead. ### Embrace the finitude of time\n\nWe recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we\'ll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don\'t have to consciously participate in what it\'s like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality. Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they\'re really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it\'s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won\'t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It\'s also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won\'t be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn\'t risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have. #### Heal yourself from FOMO\nIn practical terms, a limit-embracing attitude to time means organizing your days with the understanding that you definitely won\'t have time for everything you want to do, or that other people want you to do, and so, at the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing. Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all. It also means resisting the temptation to ""keep your options open"" in favour of deliberately making big, daunting, irreversible commitments, which you can\'t know in advance will turn out for the best, but which reliably prove more fulfilling in the end. And it means standing firm in the face of FOMO (fear of missing out) because you come to realize that missing out on something (indeed on almost everything) is basically guaranteed. Which isn\'t actually a problem anyway, it turns to, because ""missing out"" is what makes your choices meaningful in the first place. Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn\'t, and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you. ### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won\'t ever completely go away, we\'re even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I\'m aware of no other time management technique that\'s half as effective as just facing the way things truly are. Time pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you\'re implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you\'ll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you\'re in. Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history. #### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don\'t get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. ### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead. This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones. Our attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. We live in a constant spirit of joyless urgency. # How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency.

 'Basically they\'re always telling you to be a better cog. It doesn\'t matter how good you are, there is always room for improvement. I\'ve fallen on this trap for a long time (I\'m still getting my head out of the hole) and I\'m trying to amend things by applying the concepts on an anticapitalist mindset. The turning point was to read [Four thousand weeks: Time management for mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), the article will have book extracts mixed with my way of thinking. Some (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person.'
 'It\'s that we\'ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. ### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic. There was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still. There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. Making time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face. The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable. Soon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed. The fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"". Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead. ### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou\'ll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it\'s daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can\'t as much as you can\'t tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. ### If you don\'t disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you\'ll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. Reality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you\'ve saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It\'s true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.']",0.1249999999875,1.0

This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones. Our attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. We live in a constant spirit of joyless urgency. # How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life. To increase the efficiency we can:\n\n* [Adjust your roadmap](#adjust-your-roadmap)\n* [Reduce the time spent doing unwanted actions](#reduce-the-time-spent-doing-unwanted-actions). * [Improve the way you carry out your actions](#improve-the-way-you-carry-out-your-actions). * [Improve how you manage your tools](#improve-how-you-manage-your-tools). * [Improve your state and environment to be more efficient](#improve-your-state-and-environment-to-be-more-efficient). ## Adjust your roadmap\n\nTo be able to efficiently use your time and energy you need to identify where and how to do it given your current circumstances.

 'As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"". ## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". You want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off. If you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start. ### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"". The key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits. - A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency. With these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack. ### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. A new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can\'t manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one. When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you\'ll think about your habit throughout the day. Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don\'t have the energy to do anything else. Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it\'s cues even if you don\'t do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it\'s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It\'s also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you\'re under the mood influences of a bad habit. A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won\'t even have the chance to fall for the craving. ## Working with the habit cravings\n\n### Temptation bundling\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving. For years we assumed that it was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.']",0.0,1.0
"What drives job security anxiety, especially with authority and workplace dynamics?","Job security anxiety is driven by several factors, including the fear of losing one's job, which leads to self-preservation and abstaining from saying something that may be perceived as wrong to someone in authority. Additionally, there is a fear of being singled out when giving direct feedback, which can put an employee in the spotlight and be perceived as a threat, particularly for those from different racial, gender, or national backgrounds. Feelings of insecurity may arise from distrust of colleagues, especially for new employees or those with negative past experiences. Lastly, distrust in open-door policies due to past experiences in other companies can contribute to this anxiety, as employees may feel that their supervisor's opinion holds significant power over their career and financial security.","['Assumptions that led\nthem astray are identified and their origins explored.'

 'It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. Time management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. - Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead. ### Embrace the finitude of time\n\nWe recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we\'ll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don\'t have to consciously participate in what it\'s like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality. Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they\'re really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it\'s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won\'t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It\'s also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won\'t be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn\'t risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have. #### Heal yourself from FOMO\nIn practical terms, a limit-embracing attitude to time means organizing your days with the understanding that you definitely won\'t have time for everything you want to do, or that other people want you to do, and so, at the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing. Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all. It also means resisting the temptation to ""keep your options open"" in favour of deliberately making big, daunting, irreversible commitments, which you can\'t know in advance will turn out for the best, but which reliably prove more fulfilling in the end. And it means standing firm in the face of FOMO (fear of missing out) because you come to realize that missing out on something (indeed on almost everything) is basically guaranteed. Which isn\'t actually a problem anyway, it turns to, because ""missing out"" is what makes your choices meaningful in the first place. Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn\'t, and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you. ### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won\'t ever completely go away, we\'re even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I\'m aware of no other time management technique that\'s half as effective as just facing the way things truly are. Time pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you\'re implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you\'ll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you\'re in. Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history. #### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community.

And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. ### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead.

 'Basically they\'re always telling you to be a better cog. It doesn\'t matter how good you are, there is always room for improvement. I\'ve fallen on this trap for a long time (I\'m still getting my head out of the hole) and I\'m trying to amend things by applying the concepts on an anticapitalist mindset. The turning point was to read [Four thousand weeks: Time management for mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), the article will have book extracts mixed with my way of thinking. Some (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person.'
 'It\'s that we\'ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. ### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic. There was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still. There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. Making time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face. The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable. Soon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed. The fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"". Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead. ### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou\'ll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it\'s daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can\'t as much as you can\'t tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. ### If you don\'t disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you\'ll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. Reality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you\'ve saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It\'s true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.'

I feel that out of respect of ourselves and the other's time, we need\nto change that perspective.

 'A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. A [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition. When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.'

You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"". ## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". You want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable.

If you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start. ### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"". The key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits. - A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency. With these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack. ### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. A new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can\'t manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one. When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you\'ll think about your habit throughout the day. Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don\'t have the energy to do anything else. Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it\'s cues even if you don\'t do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it\'s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It\'s also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you\'re under the mood influences of a bad habit. A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won\'t even have the chance to fall for the craving. ## Working with the habit cravings\n\n### Temptation bundling\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving. For years we assumed that it was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.'
 ""This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. Mastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance. # How to manage habits\n## Track your habit management\nYou can have a `habits.org` file where you prioritize, analyze, track them. I'm using the next headings:\n\n* *Habits being implemented*: It's subdivided in two:\n  * Habits that need attention\n  * Habits that don't need attention\n* *Unclassified habits*: Useful when refiling habits from your inbox. This list will be analyzed when you do habit analysis. * *Backlog of habits*: Unrefined and unordered list of habits\n* Implemented habits:\n* Rejected habits:\n\nEach habit is a `TODO` item with the usual states: `TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`, `REJECTED`. In it's body I keep a log of the evolution and the analysis of the habit. ## Habit management workflow\n\nEach month I'm trying to go through the list of habits to:\n\n- Update the state of the habits: Some will be done, rejected or to register ideas about them. - Decide which ones need attention.""
 'It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. Time management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. - Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead. ### Embrace the finitude of time\n\nWe recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we\'ll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don\'t have to consciously participate in what it\'s like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality. Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they\'re really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it\'s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won\'t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It\'s also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won\'t be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn\'t risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have. #### Heal yourself from FOMO\nIn practical terms, a limit-embracing attitude to time means organizing your days with the understanding that you definitely won\'t have time for everything you want to do, or that other people want you to do, and so, at the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing. Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all. It also means resisting the temptation to ""keep your options open"" in favour of deliberately making big, daunting, irreversible commitments, which you can\'t know in advance will turn out for the best, but which reliably prove more fulfilling in the end. And it means standing firm in the face of FOMO (fear of missing out) because you come to realize that missing out on something (indeed on almost everything) is basically guaranteed. Which isn\'t actually a problem anyway, it turns to, because ""missing out"" is what makes your choices meaningful in the first place. Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn\'t, and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you. ### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won\'t ever completely go away, we\'re even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I\'m aware of no other time management technique that\'s half as effective as just facing the way things truly are. Time pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you\'re implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you\'ll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you\'re in. Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history. #### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don\'t get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. ### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead. This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones. Our attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. We live in a constant spirit of joyless urgency. # How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency.

The meeting goes as follows:\n\n* The product owner explains what items have been “Done” and what has not been\n    “Done”. * The product owner discuss what went well during the sprint, what problems they\n    ran into, and how those problems were solved. * The developers demonstrate the work that it has “Done” and answers questions. * The product owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands in terms of the\n    semester OKRs. * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review\n    provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning. As the target audience are the stakeholders, the language must be changed\naccordingly, we should give overall ideas and not get caught in complicated high\ntech detailed explanations unless they ask them. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Increase the transparency on what the team has done in the sprint. By\n    explaining to the stake holders:\n\n    * What has been done. * The reasons why we've implemented the specific outcomes for the tasks. * The deviation from the expected plan of action. * The status of the unfinished tasks with an explanation of why weren't they\n        closed. * The meaning of the work done in terms of the semester OKRs. * Increase the transparency on what the team plans to do for the following\n    sprint by explaining to the stakeholders:\n\n    * What do we plan to do in the next semester. * How we plan to do it. * The meaning of the plan in terms of the semester OKRs. * Get the feedback from the stakeholders. We expect to gather and process their\n    feedback by processing their opinions both of the work done of the past\n    sprint and the work to be done in the next one. It will be gathered by the\n    scrum master and persisted in the board on the planning meetings. * Incorporate the stakeholders in the decision making process of the team. By\n    inviting them to define with the rest of the scrum team the tasks for the\n    next sprint. ## Planning meetings\n\nPlannings are the meetings where the scrum team decides what it's going to do in\nthe following sprint. The decision is made with the information gathered in the\nrefinement, retro and review sessions. Conducted by the scrum master, usually only the members of the scrum team\n(developers, product owner and scrum master) are present, but stakeholders can\nalso be invited. If the job has been done in the previous sessions, the backlog should be\npriorized and refined, so we should only add the newest issues gathered in the\nretro and review, refine them and decide what we want to do this sprint. The meeting goes as follows:\n\n* We add the issues raised in the review to the backlog. * We analyze the tasks on the top of the backlog, add them to the sprint\n    board without assigning it to any developer. * Once all tasks are added, we the stats of past sprints to see if the scope is\n    realistic. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Assert that the tasks added to the sprint follow the global path defined by\n    the semester OKRs. * All team has a clear view of what needs to be done.""
 ""* Status of uncompleted tasks, and reason why they weren't complete. * The meaning of the work done in terms of the semester OKRs. * Create the report of the proposed next sprint's planning, with\n            arguments behind why we do each task. * Conduct the review meeting presenting the reports to the stakeholders. * Attend the daily, review, retro and planning meetings. ## Scrum master\n\nScrum master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in this document. This position is going to be rotated between the members of the scrum team with\na period of two sprints. It's roles are:\n\n* Monitoring the status of the semester OKRs on reviews and plannings. * Create new tasks required to meet the objectives. * Refining the backlog:\n    * Adjust priority. * Refine the tasks that are going to enter next sprint. * Organize the required meetings to refine the backlog with the team\n        members. * Delete deprecated tasks. * Assert that issues that are going to enter the new sprint meet the [Definition\n    of Ready](#definition-of-ready). * Arrange, prepare the daily meetings:\n    * Update the calendar events according to the week needs. * Arrange, prepare and conduct the review meeting:\n    * Create the calendar event inviting the scrum team and the stakeholders. * With the help of the product owner, prepare the reports:\n        * Create the report of the sprint, including:\n            * Make sure that the [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done) is\n                met for the closed tasks. * Explanation of the done tasks.""
 ""---\ntitle: Scrum\ndate: 20210302\nauthor: Lyz\n---\n\n[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an\n[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for\ndeveloping, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial\nemphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such\nas personal task management. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,\nwho break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed\niterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two\nweeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,\ncalled daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to\ndemonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and\na sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks. For my personal scrum workflow and in the DevOps and DevSecOps teams I've found\nthat Sprint goals are not operative, as multiple unrelated tasks need to\nbe done, so it doesn't make sense to define just one goal. # The meetings\n\nScrum tries to minimize the time spent in meetings while keeping a clearly\ndefined direction and a healthy environment between all the people involved in\nthe project. To achieve that is uses four types of meetings:\n\n* [Daily](#daily-meetings). * [Refinement](#refinement-meetings). * [Retros](#retro-meetings). * [Reviews](#review-meetings). * [Plannings](#planning-meetings). ## Daily meetings\n\nDailies or weeklies are the meetings where the development team exposes at high level of\ndetail the current work. Similar to the dailies in the scrum terms, in the\nmeeting each development team member exposes:\n\n* The advances in the assigned tasks, with special interest in the encountered\n    problems and deviations from the steps defined in the refinement. * An estimation of the tasks that are going to be left unfinished by the end of\n    the sprint. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Get a general knowledge of what everyone else is doing. * Learn from the experience gained by the others while doing their tasks. * Get a clear idea of where we stand in terms of completing the sprint tasks. As opposed to what it may seem, this meeting is not meant to keep track of the\nproductivity of each of us, we work based on trust, and know that each of us is\nworking our best. ## Refinement meetings\n\nRefinement are the meetings where the development team reviews the issues in the\nbacklog and prepares the tasks that will probably be done in the following\nsprint. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Next sprint tasks are ready to be worked upon in the next sprint. That means\n    each task:\n    * Meets the Definition of Ready. * All disambiguation in task description, validation criteria and steps\n        is solved. * Make the Planning meeting more dynamic. The meeting is composed of the following phases:\n\n* Scrum master preparation. * Development team refinement. * Product owner refinement. ### Refinement preparation\n\nTo prepare the refinement, the scrum master has to:\n\n* Make a copy of the [Refinement document template](refinement_template.md). * Open the OKRs document if you have one and for category in OKR categories:\n  * Select the category label in the issue tracker and select the milestone of\n      the semester. * Review which of those issues might enter the next sprint, and set the sprint\n      project on them. * Remove the milestone from the issue filter to see if there are interesting\n      issues without the milestone set. * Go to the next sprint Kanban board:\n  * Order the issues by priority. * Make sure there are tasks with the `Good first issue` label. * Make sure that there are more tasks than we can probably do so we can remove\n      some instead of need to review the backlog and add more in the\n      refinement. * Fill up the sprint goals section of the refinement document. * Create the Refinement developer team and product owner meeting calendar\n    events. ### Development team refinement meeting\n\nIn this meeting the development team with the help of the scrum master, reviews\nthe tasks to be added to the next sprint. The steps are defined in the\nrefinement template. ### Product owner refinement meeting\n\nIn this meeting the product owner with the help of the scrum master reviews\nthe tasks to be added to the next sprint. With the refinement document as\nreference:\n\n* The expected current sprint undone tasks are reviewed. * The sprint goals are discussed, modified and agreed. If there are many\n    changes, we might think of setting the goals together in next sprints. * The scrum master does a quick description of each issue. * Each task priority is discussed and updated. ## Retro meetings\n\nRetrospectives or Retros are the meetings where the scrum team plan ways to\nincrease the quality and effectiveness of the team. The scrum master conducts different dynamics to help the rest of the scrum team\ninspect how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions,\nprocesses, tools, and their Definition of Done and Ready.""
