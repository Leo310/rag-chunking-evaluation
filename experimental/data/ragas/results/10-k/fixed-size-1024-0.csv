What are the potential dangers associated with an altered sleep profile?,"A potential danger associated with an altered sleep profile is the loss of REM sleep.

The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.\n\nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams.

None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.\n\nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place.

Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all. It also means resisting the temptation to ""keep your options open"" in favour of deliberately making big, daunting, irreversible commitments, which you can\'t know in advance will turn out for the best, but which reliably prove more fulfilling in the end. And it means standing firm in the face of FOMO (fear of missing out) because you come to realize that missing out on something (indeed on almost everything) is basically guaranteed.
