What four stages are key for building good habits?,"The four stages key for building good habits are: Cue: Make it obvious, Craving: Make it attractive, Response: Make it easy, Reward: Make it satisfying.","['A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\n\nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.\n\nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you'
 'his approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".\n\n## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why.'
 "". The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.\n\nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.\n\nWe chase rewards because they:\n\n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\n\nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.\n\nIf we keep these stages in mind then:\n\n- To build good habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it obvious\n    - Craving: Make it attractive\n    - Response: Make it easy\n    - Reward: Make it satisfying\n\n- To break bad habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it invisible""
 ""you want to be\n\nOne way to decide the person you want to be is to answer big questions like: what do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become? \n\nAs we're more result oriented, another way is to work backwards from them to the person you want to be. Ask yourself: Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?\n\n# How to change a habit\n\nThe process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:\n\n- **Reward** is the end goal.\n- **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour. It's contains the information that predicts a reward.\n- **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act.\n- **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.\n\nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four s""
 'to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.\n\n### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [cur'
 ""havior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.\n\n# How to manage habits\n## Track your habit management\nYou can have a `habits.org` file where you prioritize, analyze, track them.\n\nI'm using the next headings:\n\n* *Habits being implemented*: It's subdivided in two:\n  * Habits that need attention\n  * Habits that don't need attention\n* *Unclassified habits*: Useful when refiling habits from your inbox. This list will be analyzed when you do habit analysis.\n* *Backlog of habits*: Unrefined and unordered list of habits\n* Implemented habits:\n* Rejected habits:\n\nEach habit is a `TODO` item with the usual states: `TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`, `REJECTED`. In it's bo""
 ""t draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.\n\nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may b""
 'st is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".\n\nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. \n\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.\n\nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.\n\n### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour.

How do habit triggers affect habit stacking for behavior change?,"The context discusses understanding and tweaking the triggers that produce habits as a starting point for habit design, which is essential for effective habit stacking.

You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".\n\nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. \n\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.\n\nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.\n\n### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why.'
 ""t draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.\n\nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work.

And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.\n\n### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one.

 'A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\n\nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.\n\nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself.

Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit. \n\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.\n\n## Working with the habit cravings\n\n### Temptation bundling\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving.

 ""was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.\n\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action. \n\nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through. \n\nTemptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time. In the end you may even look forward to do the habit you need as it's related to the habit you want.\n\n### Align your personal identity change with an existent shared identity\n\nWe pick up habits from the people around us.

This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. \n\nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.\n\nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has bee""

And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.\n\nWe chase rewards because they:\n\n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\n\nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.\n\nIf we keep these stages in mind then:\n\n- To build good habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it obvious\n    - Craving: Make it attractive\n    - Response: Make it easy\n    - Reward: Make it satisfying\n\n- To break bad habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it invisible""

As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.\n\nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.\n\nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine.

 ""In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\n    leaning towards eveningness.\n\n### Melatonin\n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night\nto your brain and body by releasing\n[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from\nthe pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it's time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.\n\nOnce sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain\nand body that it's time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of\nthe day\n\n## Sleep pressure\n\nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a che""

 '* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\n    which to remove.\n\nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.\n\nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time.

How do cues affect cravings and habits?,"Cues affect cravings and habits by serving as visual triggers that draw your attention towards the desired habit. When environmental cues reappear, the urge to act on the encoded habit follows, which can lead to a reinforcement of both good and bad habits. For instance, bad habits can spiral as the craving grows stronger with each repetition of the behavior, such as watching TV leading to increased sluggishness and further television watching.","[""t draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.\n\nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work.

They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. \n\nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.\n\nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has bee""
 "". The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.\n\nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.\n\nWe chase rewards because they:\n\n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\n\nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.\n\nIf we keep these stages in mind then:\n\n- To build good habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it obvious\n    - Craving: Make it attractive\n    - Response: Make it easy\n    - Reward: Make it satisfying\n\n- To break bad habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it invisible""
 'his approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".\n\n## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why.'
 'st is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".\n\nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. \n\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.\n\nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.\n\n### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour.

 'A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\n\nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.\n\nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you'
 ""he long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit. \n\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.\n\n## Working with the habit cravings\n\n### Temptation bundling\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving. For years we assumed that it was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.\n\nHabits are""
 'to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.\n\n### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [cur'

 ""was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.\n\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action. \n\nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through. \n\nTemptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time. In the end you may even look forward to do the habit you need as it's related to the habit you want.\n\n### Align your personal identity change with an existent shared identity\n\nWe pick up habits from the people around us.
