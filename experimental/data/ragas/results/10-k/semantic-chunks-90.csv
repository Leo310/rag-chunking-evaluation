 '* [Plannings](#planning-meetings). ## Daily meetings\n\nDailies or weeklies are the meetings where the development team exposes at high level of\ndetail the current work. Similar to the dailies in the scrum terms, in the\nmeeting each development team member exposes:\n\n* The advances in the assigned tasks, with special interest in the encountered\n    problems and deviations from the steps defined in the refinement. * An estimation of the tasks that are going to be left unfinished by the end of\n    the sprint. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Get a general knowledge of what everyone else is doing. * Learn from the experience gained by the others while doing their tasks. * Get a clear idea of where we stand in terms of completing the sprint tasks. As opposed to what it may seem, this meeting is not meant to keep track of the\nproductivity of each of us, we work based on trust, and know that each of us is\nworking our best. ## Refinement meetings\n\nRefinement are the meetings where the development team reviews the issues in the\nbacklog and prepares the tasks that will probably be done in the following\nsprint. The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Next sprint tasks are ready to be worked upon in the next sprint. That means\n    each task:\n    * Meets the Definition of Ready. * All disambiguation in task description, validation criteria and steps\n        is solved. * Make the Planning meeting more dynamic. The meeting is composed of the following phases:\n\n* Scrum master preparation. * Development team refinement. * Product owner refinement. ### Refinement preparation\n\nTo prepare the refinement, the scrum master has to:\n\n* Make a copy of the [Refinement document template](refinement_template.md). * Open the OKRs document if you have one and for category in OKR categories:\n  * Select the category label in the issue tracker and select the milestone of\n      the semester. * Review which of those issues might enter the next sprint, and set the sprint\n      project on them. * Remove the milestone from the issue filter to see if there are interesting\n      issues without the milestone set. * Go to the next sprint Kanban board:\n  * Order the issues by priority. * Make sure there are tasks with the `Good first issue` label. * Make sure that there are more tasks than we can probably do so we can remove\n      some instead of need to review the backlog and add more in the\n      refinement. * Fill up the sprint goals section of the refinement document. * Create the Refinement developer team and product owner meeting calendar\n    events. ### Development team refinement meeting\n\nIn this meeting the development team with the help of the scrum master, reviews\nthe tasks to be added to the next sprint. The steps are defined in the\nrefinement template. ### Product owner refinement meeting\n\nIn this meeting the product owner with the help of the scrum master reviews\nthe tasks to be added to the next sprint. With the refinement document as\nreference:\n\n* The expected current sprint undone tasks are reviewed. * The sprint goals are discussed, modified and agreed. If there are many\n    changes, we might think of setting the goals together in next sprints. * The scrum master does a quick description of each issue.'

For my personal scrum workflow and in the DevOps and DevSecOps teams I've found\nthat Sprint goals are not operative, as multiple unrelated tasks need to\nbe done, so it doesn't make sense to define just one goal. # The meetings\n\nScrum tries to minimize the time spent in meetings while keeping a clearly\ndefined direction and a healthy environment between all the people involved in\nthe project.

What role does self-discipline play in the pursuit of effective time management?,"Self-discipline plays a crucial role in the pursuit of effective time management, as it is necessary to follow the right time management system and build the right habits to improve efficiency.","['Using time effectively gives the person ""choice"" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency. To be able to do time management, you first need to define how do you want to increase your effectiveness and efficiency. For me, it means increasing the amount and quality of actions per unit of time or effort.'
 ""That's a tainted way of thinking about your personal time.""
 'This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel.'
 'Assumptions that led\nthem astray are identified and their origins explored.'
 'As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. Making time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face. The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable. Soon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed. The fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"". Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead. ### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou\'ll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it\'s daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can\'t as much as you can\'t tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. ### If you don\'t disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you\'ll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. Reality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you\'ve saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It\'s true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.'

"How are concentration, control, and flow linked in Pilates?","Concentration, control, and flow in Pilates are linked through the need for intense focus on body awareness and movement precision. Concentration is essential for controlling muscles against resistance, while flow is achieved by creating smooth transitions between exercises once precision is mastered. This interconnectedness helps build strength and stamina.","[""Pilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of\ndifficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of\nthe instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations. Intensity\ncan be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises. You can think of yoga, but without the spiritual aspects. # [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n\n## Breathing\n\nThe breathing in Pilates is meant the to be deeper, with full inhalations and\ncomplete exhalations. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up. When\ninhaling you need to maintain this engagement to keep the core in control. The difficult part comes when you try to properly coordinate this\nbreathing practice with the exercise movement, breathes out with the\neffort and in on the return. This technique is important as it increases the intake of oxygen and the circulation\nof this oxygenated blood to every part of the body, cleaning and\ninvigorating it. ## Concentration\n\nIt demands intense focus, as you need to be aware of the position of each part\nof your body, and how they move to precisely do the exercise. ## Control\n\nYou don't see many quick movements, most of the exercises are anaerobic. The\ndifficult relies on controlling your muscles to do what you want them to while\nthey fight against gravity, springs and other torture tools. ## Flow\n\nPilates aims for elegant economy of movement, creating flow through the use of\nappropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are\nintended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and\nstamina. A smoothly doing a roll down (from seated position with your legs straight, slowly lay\ndown, vertebrae by vertebrae) is a difficult challenge, as you need every muscle\nto coordinate to share the load of the weight. The muscles that we use more are\nstronger, and some of them are barely used, Pilates positions and slow\ntransitions force you to use those weak, forgotten muscles, and when the load is\ntransferred from the strong to the weak, your body starts shaking or breaks the\nmovement rate thus breaking the flow.""

What's the best brushing routine for gum health?,"The best brushing routine for gum health is to brush for a minimum of two minutes, at least twice a day, and ideally after each meal. This routine helps in maintaining oral hygiene and can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums.","[""Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle. When using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes. Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood. ### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly.""
 ""If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities. So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal. Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin. For maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.

They can check if you're flossing correctly. ## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth. [[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]\n\nChoose a different time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch.

 'This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur. ## Teeth brushing\n\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29). The dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants.'
 '# How to take care of your teeth\n\n??? note ""TL;DR: Daily actions to keep your teeth healty""\n    * [Brush your teeth](#how-to-brush-your-teeth) after every meal for at least two minutes. * [Floss each day](#how-to-floss) before the last teeth brush. * Use an [electric toothbrush](#manual-versus-electric-tooth-brush). * [Replace the brush](#toothbrush-replacement) each three months or at first\n        sign of wear and tear. * Don\'t eat or drink anything but water after your nightly brush. * [Do not rinse after you brush your teeth](#to-rinse-or-not-to-rinse). * [Use floss instead of a toothpick](#how-to-floss). * [Use mouthwash daily but not after brushing](#mouth-washing). Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one\'s mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis). General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing.'
 ""Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks. That's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work. ### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:\n\n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste. * Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\n    to tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\n    massage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\n    outside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\n    side teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\n    your left side. Try to avoid brushing with too much force as this can\n    damage the surface of your teeth.""
 ""If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference. ### [Keep your brush away from your feces](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAs the [Mythbusters showed](https://mythresults.com/episode12), Fecal coliform\nwere found on toothbrushes stored at the bathroom. And even though none were of\na level high enough to be dangerous, and experts confirm that such bacteria are\nimpossible to completely avoid, you can reduce the risk by:\n\n* Storing the brush in a cupboard or in other room. * Putting a lid on your toothbrush\n* Closing the lid on your toilet seat before flushing. ## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\n\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession. The correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))\n\n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers. * For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\n    with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\n    between the fingers. * Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\n    snap the floss into the gums. * When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\n    until you feel resistance. * Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\n    the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\n    side of the next tooth. * Do not forget the back of your last tooth. * Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\n    and down motion. You should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing. Another [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):\n\n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.""
 ""* Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and repeat the cycle. * Brush your tongue. * Spit the extra toothpaste but don't rinse or drink anything in the next 30\n    minutes. The whole process should take at least two minutes. ### Manual versus electric tooth brush\n\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums. The technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention.""

What genes and hormones affect chronotype and peak wakefulness?,The answer to given question is not present in context,"[""But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake. This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.""
 'This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel.'
 '* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\n    population. The peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit\'s known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit\'s strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:\n\n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\n    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\n    function optimally at this time of day. * *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\n    the following morning, or even in the afternoon. * *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\n    leaning towards eveningness. ### Melatonin\n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night\nto your brain and body by releasing\n[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from\nthe pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it\'s time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself. Once sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain\nand body that it\'s time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of\nthe day\n\n## Sleep pressure\n\nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones.'

Contrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm. * The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes. Even if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days. That reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:\n\n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\n    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\n    timezone travel. * Their short term memory was significantly impaired.""
 'It also has another side-effect.'
 ""Unlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake. ### Am I getting enough sleep? When you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt\n\nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation. Other sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence. Of course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder. ## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2. In REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases. ![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)\n\nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM. But as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating. Although there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:\n\n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity. * The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.""
