 ""By remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.\n\n### Am I getting enough sleep?\n\nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt\n\nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.\n\nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.\n\nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.\n\n## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.""
 'An enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.\n\nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to\nfunction and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.\n\nFor the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on\nbuilding up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging\nchemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.\nOnce your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you\nare hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before\nyou drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated\nin the hours in between.\n\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\n\nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.\n\n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)\n\nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.'
 ""Now let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.\n\nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.\n\nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.\n\nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.\n\n### All-nighters\n\nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.\n\nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,\n\n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)""
 ""In REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.\n\n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)\n\nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.\n\nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:\n\n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\n    which to remove.\n\nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.""
 'The suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night\nto your brain and body by releasing\n[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from\nthe pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it\'s time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.\n\nOnce sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain\nand body that it\'s time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of\nthe day\n\n## Sleep pressure\n\nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones. Most people fall to the pressure\nafter twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.\n\n### Caffeine\n\nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively\ninactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.\n\nLevels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is\nproblematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes\nbetween five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration\nfrom your body.'
 ""A danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.\n\n## Sleeping time and sense distortions\n\nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.\n\nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.\n\nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.\n\n# How your brain generates sleep""
 ""Brainwave activity of REM sleep looks similar to the one you have when you're\nawake. They cycle (going up and down) at a fast frequency of thirty or forty\ntimes per second in an unreliable pattern. This behaviour is explained by the\nfact that different parts of your waking brain are processing different pieces\nof information at different moments in time and in different ways.\n\n![ ](brainwaves.jpg)\n\n# References\n\n* [Why we sleep book by Matthew Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)\n- [The forgotten medieval habit of two sleeps](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep)\n- [Jet lag calculator](https://www.sleepjunkie.com/jet-lag-calculator/)\n[![](not-by-ai.svg){: .center}](https://notbyai.fyi)""]",0.6666666666444444,1.0
What was the significance of the invention of mechanical clocks in relation to the measurement of time?,"The significance of the invention of mechanical clocks in relation to the measurement of time is that they provided a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time, which is essential for coordinating the actions of more than a handful of people. This standardization and visibility of time encouraged people to think of it as an abstract concept with an independent existence, separate from specific activities.","['There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. \n\nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'

 ""Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.\n\n### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou'll see everywhere the concept of `time management`.

 'There is a widespread feeling that we\'re always short on time. We\'re obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we\'re deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time. And it get\'s worse as you age because time seems to speed up as you get older, steadily accelerating until months begging to flash by in what feels like minutes. \n\nThe real problem isn\'t our limited time. It\'s that we\'ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. \n\n### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.\n\nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.'
 'It also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It\'s somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.\n\nDenying reality never works though. It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. \n\nTime management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. \n- Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.'

 '#### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships.  In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don\'t get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. \n\n### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead. This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones.\n\nOur attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move.

The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.\n\n### Am I getting enough sleep?\n\nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt\n\nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.\n\nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.\n\nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.\n\n## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.""]",0.9999999999,1.0

You need to be at a certain level of the social ladder to even start thinking in these terms. And depending on the number of oppressions you\'re suffering you\'ll have more or less room to maneuver. That margin is completely outside our control so by no means we should feel guilty of not being able to manage time. What follows are just guidelines to deal with this time anxiety imposed by the capitalist system with whatever air we have to breath.\n## Changing the language\n\nThe easiest way to change the underlying meaning is to change the language. Some substitutions are:'
 'There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. \n\nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'

 'It also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It\'s somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.\n\nDenying reality never works though. It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. \n\nTime management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. \n- Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.'
 'Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical\ndecisions and choices. It recalibrates our emotional brain circuits, allowing us\nto navigate next day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed\ncomposture.\n\nDownstairs in the body, sleep:\n\n* Restocks the armory of our immune system: helping fight malignancy, preventing\n    infection, and warding off sickness.\n* Reforms the body\'s metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and\n    circulating glucose.\n* Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food\n    selection rather than rash impulsivity.\n* Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut essential to our\n    nutritional health being.\n* Is tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure\n    while keeping our hearts in fine condition.\n\nDreaming produces a neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and\na virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge,\ninspiring creativity.\n\nTherefore, **Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our\nbrain and body health each day**.\n\n# Sleep physiological effects\n\nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:\n\n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\n    the ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\n    sleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.\n\n## The circadian rhythm\n\nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:'
 ""* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.\n\nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.\n\nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:\n\n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\n    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\n    timezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\n    population.\n\nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:\n\n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\n    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\n    function optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\n    the following morning, or even in the afternoon.\n* *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\n    leaning towards eveningness.\n\n### Melatonin""
 ""Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.\n\n### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou'll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it's daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can't as much as you can't tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. \n\n### If you don't disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. \n\nReality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you've saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up.

 'There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish.

""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'
 'It also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It\'s somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.\n\nDenying reality never works though. It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. \n\nTime management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. \n- Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.'

 ""Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives.

It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result.

 ""A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.\n\nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.\n\nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.\n\nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.\n\n# How to manage habits\n## Track your habit management\nYou can have a `habits.org` file where you prioritize, analyze, track them.\n\nI'm using the next headings:\n\n* *Habits being implemented*: It's subdivided in two:\n  * Habits that need attention\n  * Habits that don't need attention\n* *Unclassified habits*: Useful when refiling habits from your inbox.

 'There is a widespread feeling that we\'re always short on time. We\'re obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we\'re deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time. And it get\'s worse as you age because time seems to speed up as you get older, steadily accelerating until months begging to flash by in what feels like minutes. \n\nThe real problem isn\'t our limited time. It\'s that we\'ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. \n\n### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.\n\nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.'

As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it.

We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.\n\n### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".'
 ""A formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\n    superficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without\n    mentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that\n    no one talks about because they know they are so important that they could\n    stir things up.\n\n    In fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\n    brought to the table as soon as possible. They should be addressed by the\n    entire team before they become a source of unhappiness, conflict and lack of\n    productivity.\n\n    An anonymous feedback instrument gives you real power over those issues\n    because it doesn't matter who brought it up, but that it’s resolved. For\n    a manager, that insight is invaluable.\n\n* *It builds trust*: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management\n    reacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and\n    sometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied\n    and build up self esteem.\n\n* *It offers a sense of security*: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and\n    creates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions.\n\n* *It allows every voice to be heard and respected*: In workplaces, where they\n    practice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some\n    voices over others. Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher\n    authority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention.\n    In such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate\n    attention than those raised by the rest of the group. However, when feedback\n    is collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus\n    entirely on the feedback.""

How does focusing on now affect time mgmt and social ties?,"Focusing on the present can affect time management and social ties by highlighting the importance of community and relationships over individualistic control of one's schedule. It suggests that true freedom and meaningful efficiency come from participating in social life and allowing oneself to be constrained by community rhythms, rather than solely seeking personal sovereignty over time. This shift in focus can lead to a more fulfilling use of time, as it encourages individuals to prioritize what truly matters and to engage with others, rather than living in a constant state of urgency and future anticipation.","['There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. \n\nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'

You need to be at a certain level of the social ladder to even start thinking in these terms. And depending on the number of oppressions you\'re suffering you\'ll have more or less room to maneuver. That margin is completely outside our control so by no means we should feel guilty of not being able to manage time. What follows are just guidelines to deal with this time anxiety imposed by the capitalist system with whatever air we have to breath.\n## Changing the language\n\nThe easiest way to change the underlying meaning is to change the language. Some substitutions are:'
 '#### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships.  In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don\'t get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. \n\n### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead. This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones.\n\nOur attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. We live in a constant spirit of joyless urgency.\n\n# How to manage time'

As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.\n\nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:\n\n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\n    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\n    timezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\n    population.\n\nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:\n\n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\n    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\n    function optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\n    the following morning, or even in the afternoon.\n* *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\n    leaning towards eveningness.\n\n### Melatonin""
 'There is a widespread feeling that we\'re always short on time. We\'re obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we\'re deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time. And it get\'s worse as you age because time seems to speed up as you get older, steadily accelerating until months begging to flash by in what feels like minutes. \n\nThe real problem isn\'t our limited time. It\'s that we\'ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. \n\n### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.\n\nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.'
 ""The rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life.\n\nTo increase the efficiency we can:\n\n* [Adjust your roadmap](#adjust-your-roadmap)\n* [Reduce the time spent doing unwanted actions](#reduce-the-time-spent-doing-unwanted-actions).\n* [Improve the way you carry out your actions](#improve-the-way-you-carry-out-your-actions).\n* [Improve how you manage your tools](#improve-how-you-manage-your-tools).\n* [Improve your state and environment to be more efficient](#improve-your-state-and-environment-to-be-more-efficient).\n\n## Adjust your roadmap\n\nTo be able to efficiently use your time and energy you need to identify where and how to do it given your current circumstances.

 ""### Embrace the finitude of time\n\nWe recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we'll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don't have to consciously participate in what it's like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality.\n\nOur troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they're really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it's painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won't have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It's also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won't be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn't risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have.""]",0.9593749999880078,1.0
How does flossing before or after brushing affect plaque removal?,"Flossing before brushing helps remove food, plaque, and bacteria, which are then further removed by brushing afterwards.","[""Some people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush.  Similarly, if you consume a lot of sugar, you should\nprobably avoid rinsing. If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference.\n\n### [Keep your brush away from your feces](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAs the [Mythbusters showed](https://mythresults.com/episode12), Fecal coliform\nwere found on toothbrushes stored at the bathroom. And even though none were of\na level high enough to be dangerous, and experts confirm that such bacteria are\nimpossible to completely avoid, you can reduce the risk by:\n\n* Storing the brush in a cupboard or in other room.\n* Putting a lid on your toothbrush\n* Closing the lid on your toilet seat before flushing.\n\n## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\n\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.\n\nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))""
 ""General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.\n\nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.\n\n## Teeth brushing\n\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).\n\nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.\n\nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.\n\nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.\n\nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.""
 ""Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.\n\nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.\n\nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.\n\nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.\n\n### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:""
 ""Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.\n\n### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility.\n[1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush.\n\n### To rinse or not to rinse\n\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth. ([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))\n\nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:\n\n* You’ll get rid of the excess toothpaste along with any food or bacteria that\n    could have been stuck in your teeth or released by the brushing itself.\n* You’ll also be removing the fluoride from your mouth, which if swallowed,\n    might upset your stomach.\n\nPeople against rinsing your mouth argue that:\n\n* When you rinse with water, you’re potentially washing away any remnants of\n    toothpaste, including the fluoride that makes it work. That could mean that\n    even though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\n    should be.\n\nWhilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other. So it's up to\nyou to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method.""
 ""* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\n    with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\n    between the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\n    snap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\n    until you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\n    the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\n    side of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\n    and down motion.\n\nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.\n\nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):\n\n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.\n* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.\n\nWhen you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier.  If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly.\n\n## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth.\n[[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]""
 ""* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste.\n* Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\n    to tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\n    massage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\n    outside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\n    side teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\n    your left side. Try to avoid brushing with too much force as this can\n    damage the surface of your teeth.\n* Rinse with water.\n* Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and repeat the cycle.\n* Brush your tongue.\n* Spit the extra toothpaste but don't rinse or drink anything in the next 30\n    minutes.\n\nThe whole process should take at least two minutes.\n\n### Manual versus electric tooth brush\n\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.\n\nThe technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle.\n\nWhen using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles.\n\n[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.""

 'I find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".\n\n## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.\n\n### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".'

How do external pressures and time management limits affect life satisfaction and stress?,"External pressures, such as a cutthroat economy and societal expectations, contribute to time pressure and stress. Attempting to manage time with the goal of achieving total control often leads to increased stress, emptiness, and frustration. In contrast, confronting the reality of our limitations and accepting the constraints of life can lead to a more efficient, meaningful, and joyful existence.","['There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. \n\nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'
 'It also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It\'s somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.\n\nDenying reality never works though. It may provide some immediate relief, because it allows you to go on thinking that at some point in the future you might, at last, feel totally in control. But it can\'t ever bring the sense that you\'re doing enough (that you *are* enough) because it defines *enough* as a kind of limitless control that no  human can attain. Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life. For example, the more you believe yo might succeed in ""fitting everything in"", the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, and so your days inevitably fill with more activities you don\'t especially value. The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks that won\'t be hurried, the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. \n\nTime management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:\n\n- It may hide the sense of precariousness inherent to the capitalist world we live in. If you could meet every boss\'s demand, while launching various side projects on your own, maybe one day You\'d finally feel secure in your career and your finances. \n- Divert your energies from fully experiencing the reality in which you find yourself, holding at bay certain scary questions about what you\'re doing with your life, and whether major changes might not be needed. As long as you\'re always just on the cusp of mastering time, you can avoid the thought that what life is really demanding from you might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.'
 ""Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.\n\n### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou'll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it's daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can't as much as you can't tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. \n\n### If you don't disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. \n\nReality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you've saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.""
 'There is a widespread feeling that we\'re always short on time. We\'re obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we\'re deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time. And it get\'s worse as you age because time seems to speed up as you get older, steadily accelerating until months begging to flash by in what feels like minutes. \n\nThe real problem isn\'t our limited time. It\'s that we\'ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. \n\n### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.\n\nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.'
 'Some (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person. You need to be at a certain level of the social ladder to even start thinking in these terms. And depending on the number of oppressions you\'re suffering you\'ll have more or less room to maneuver. That margin is completely outside our control so by no means we should feel guilty of not being able to manage time. What follows are just guidelines to deal with this time anxiety imposed by the capitalist system with whatever air we have to breath.\n## Changing the language\n\nThe easiest way to change the underlying meaning is to change the language. Some substitutions are:'
 '#### Embrace the community constrains \nMoreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture\'s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it\'s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships.  In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don\'t get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. \n\n### Live for today not tomorrow\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what you do, we all sense that there are always more important and fulfilling ways we could be spending our time, even if we can\'t say exactly what they are, yet we systematically spend our days doing other things instead. This feeling can take many forms: the desire to devote yourself to some larger cause, continuously demanding more from yourself, desiring to spend more time with your loved ones.\n\nOur attempts to become more efficient may have the effect of pushing the genuinely important stuff even further over the horizon. Our days are spent trying to ""get through"" tasks, in order to get them ""out of the way"", with the result that we live mentally in the future, waiting for when we\'ll finally get around to what really matters, and worrying in the meantime, that we don\'t measure up, that we might lack the drive or stamina to keep pace with the speed at which life now seems to move. We live in a constant spirit of joyless urgency.\n\n# How to manage time'

 ""### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won't ever completely go away, we're even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are.\n\nTime pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.\n\nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.""]",0.9593749999880078,1.0

 ""---\ntitle: Scrum\ndate: 20210302\nauthor: Lyz\n---\n\n[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an\n[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for\ndeveloping, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial\nemphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such\nas personal task management.  It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,\nwho break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed\niterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two\nweeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,\ncalled daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to\ndemonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and\na sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks.\n\nFor my personal scrum workflow and in the DevOps and DevSecOps teams I've found\nthat Sprint goals are not operative, as multiple unrelated tasks need to\nbe done, so it doesn't make sense to define just one goal.\n\n# The meetings\n\nScrum tries to minimize the time spent in meetings while keeping a clearly\ndefined direction and a healthy environment between all the people involved in\nthe project.\n\nTo achieve that is uses four types of meetings:\n\n* [Daily](#daily-meetings).\n* [Refinement](#refinement-meetings).\n* [Retros](#retro-meetings).\n* [Reviews](#review-meetings).\n* [Plannings](#planning-meetings).\n\n## Daily meetings\n\nDailies or weeklies are the meetings where the development team exposes at high level of\ndetail the current work. Similar to the dailies in the scrum terms, in the\nmeeting each development team member exposes:\n\n* The advances in the assigned tasks, with special interest in the encountered\n    problems and deviations from the steps defined in the refinement.\n* An estimation of the tasks that are going to be left unfinished by the end of\n    the sprint.\n\nThe goals of the meeting are:""
 ""The goals of the meeting are:\n\n* Increase the transparency on what the team has done in the sprint. By\n    explaining to the stake holders:\n\n    * What has been done.\n    * The reasons why we've implemented the specific outcomes for the tasks.\n    * The deviation from the expected plan of action.\n    * The status of the unfinished tasks with an explanation of why weren't they\n        closed.\n    * The meaning of the work done in terms of the semester OKRs.\n\n* Increase the transparency on what the team plans to do for the following\n    sprint by explaining to the stakeholders:\n\n    * What do we plan to do in the next semester.\n    * How we plan to do it.\n    * The meaning of the plan in terms of the semester OKRs.\n\n* Get the feedback from the stakeholders. We expect to gather and process their\n    feedback by processing their opinions both of the work done of the past\n    sprint and the work to be done in the next one. It will be gathered by the\n    scrum master and persisted in the board on the planning meetings.\n\n* Incorporate the stakeholders in the decision making process of the team. By\n    inviting them to define with the rest of the scrum team the tasks for the\n    next sprint.\n\n## Planning meetings\n\nPlannings are the meetings where the scrum team decides what it's going to do in\nthe following sprint. The decision is made with the information gathered in the\nrefinement, retro and review sessions.\n\nConducted by the scrum master, usually only the members of the scrum team\n(developers, product owner and scrum master) are present, but stakeholders can\nalso be invited.\n\nIf the job has been done in the previous sessions, the backlog should be\npriorized and refined, so we should only add the newest issues gathered in the\nretro and review, refine them and decide what we want to do this sprint.\n\nThe meeting goes as follows:""
 ""* Arrange, prepare and conduct the refinement meetings:\n    * Prepare the tasks that need to be refined:\n        * Adjust the priority of the backlog tasks.\n        * Select the tasks that are most probably going to enter the next\n            sprint.\n        * Expand the description of those tasks so it's understandable by any\n            team member.\n        * If the task need some steps to be done before it can be worked upon,\n            do them or create a task to do them before the original task.\n    * Create the required refinement calendar events inviting the members of the\n        scrum team.\n    * Conduct the refinement meeting.\n    * Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting.\n    * Prepare the next sprint's Kanban board.\n\n* Arrange, prepare and conduct the retro meeting:\n    * Prepare the dynamics of the meeting.\n    * Create the retro calendar event inviting the members of the scrum team.\n    * Conduct the retro meeting.\n    * Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting.\n    * Upload the retro reports to the documentation repository.\n\n* Arrange, prepare and conduct the planning meeting:\n    * Make sure that you've done the required refinement sessions to have the\n        tasks and Kanban board ready for the next sprint.\n    * Create the planning calendar event inviting the members of the scrum team.\n    * Conduct the planning meeting.\n    * Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting and start the sprint.\n\n## Developer\n\nDevelopers are the people in the scrum team that are committed to creating any\naspect of a usable increment each sprint.\n\nIt's roles are:\n\n* Attend the daily, refinement, review, retro and planning meetings.\n* Focus on completing the assigned sprint tasks.\n    * Do the required work or be responsible to coordinate the work that others\n        do for the task to be complete.\n    * Make sure that the [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done) is met\n        before closing the task.\n\n# Inter team workflow\n\nTo improve the communication between the teams, you can:""

 ""A formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\n    superficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without\n    mentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that\n    no one talks about because they know they are so important that they could\n    stir things up.\n\n    In fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\n    brought to the table as soon as possible.

Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher\n    authority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention.\n    In such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate\n    attention than those raised by the rest of the group.
