What is the proper technique for flossing to ensure effective cleaning between teeth?,"The proper technique for flossing to ensure effective cleaning between teeth includes wrapping 15–25 cm of floss around your middle fingers, using your thumb and index finger for upper teeth and both index fingers for lower teeth, leaving roughly 2.5 cm between your fingers. Gently ease the floss between the teeth using a back and forth motion without snapping it into the gums. Curve the floss into a C-shape against a tooth when it reaches the gumline, hold it against the tooth, and gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap and do not forget the back of your last tooth.
