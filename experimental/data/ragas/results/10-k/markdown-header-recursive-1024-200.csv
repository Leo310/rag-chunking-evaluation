What effect does the circadian rhythm have on our desire to sleep and wakefulness?,"The circadian rhythm has a descending effect that powers down activity and alertness levels, which triggers a strong desire for sleep. As the circadian activity rhythm returns after sleep, it begins to energize and naturally wake us up.","[""## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure  \nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.""
 ""## The circadian rhythm  \nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay""
 ""powerful upswing of alertness.

Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects  \nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:  \n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\nthe ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\nsleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.'
 ""### All-nighters  \nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""
 ""* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.  \nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:  \n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\nsuggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\ntimezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\npopulation.  \nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and""
 ""### Melatonin  \nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night\nto your brain and body by releasing\n[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from\nthe pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing\nthe levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it's time to\nsleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.  \nOnce sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night\nand into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the\neyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop\nreleasing melatonin.

They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\nfunction optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\nthe following morning, or even in the afternoon.\n* *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\nleaning towards eveningness.""
 '## Sleep pressure  \nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones. Most people fall to the pressure\nafter twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.'
 ""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.""]",0.9999999999888889,1.0
What is the significance of flow in Pilates exercises?,"Flow in Pilates exercises is significant as it aims for elegant economy of movement, allowing exercises to transition smoothly into one another.

 '# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)  \n## Breathing  \nThe breathing in Pilates is meant the to be deeper, with full inhalations and\ncomplete exhalations. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up. When\ninhaling you need to maintain this engagement to keep the core in control.  \nThe difficult part comes when you try to properly coordinate this\nbreathing practice with the exercise movement, breathes out with the\neffort and in on the return.  \nThis technique is important as it increases the intake of oxygen and the circulation\nof this oxygenated blood to every part of the body, cleaning and\ninvigorating it.'

How do beliefs affect the shift to identity-based habits?,"Beliefs affect the shift to identity-based habits by influencing our world view, self-image, and judgments.

This transforms your personal identity transformation into the building of a shared one. Shared identities have great benefits over single ones:  \n- They foster belonging.

 '## Changing your identity  \nWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.  \nYour habits and systems are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. The more you repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour. To the point that your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.  \nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

 '# Where to focus when changing our habits  \n## Identity focused changes  \nChanging our habits is challenging because we try to change the wrong thing in the wrong way.  \nThere are three levels at which change can occur:  \n- Outcomes: Changing your results.

This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.'
 'Once you start the ball rolling things become easier as building habits is a feedback loop. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.  \nThe most practical way to change the identity is to:  \n- [Decide the type of person you want to be](#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)\n- Prove it to yourself with small wins  \nAnother advantage of focusing in what type of person you want to be is that maybe the outcome you wanted to focus on is not the wisest smallest step to achieve your identity change. Thinking on the identity you want to embrace can make you think outside the box.'
 ""The first path of change is doomed because maintaining behaviours that are incongruent with the self is expensive and will not last. Even if they make rational sense. Thus it's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behaviour. On the other hand it's easy to find motivation once a habit has changed your identity as you may be proud of it and will be willing to maintain all the habits and systems associated with it. For example: The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.  \nFocusing on outcomes may also bring the next problems:  \n- Focusing on the results may lead you to temporal solutions. If you focus on the source of the issue at hand you may solve it with less effort and get you to a more stable one.""

 '# Why are habits interesting  \nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.  \nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.  \nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Habits reduce the cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so they can be carried on with your nonconscious mind and you can allocate your attention to other tasks.'

 '### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change  \nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"".  \nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.  \nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year.

"What factors in mgmt authority vs. employee views affect workplace anxiety, esp. job security & trust?","Factors affecting workplace anxiety related to management authority and employee views include fear of losing their job, fear of being singled out, feelings of insecurity, and distrust in open-door internal policies. Employees may feel anxious about their job security due to the power their supervisor holds over their career and financial stability, leading to self-preservation behaviors. Additionally, the fear of being highlighted against peers can create anxiety, particularly for those from diverse backgrounds. Insecurity may arise from distrust of colleagues or negative past experiences, and distrust in open-door policies can stem from previous experiences in other companies.","[""a bigger importance that our supervisor likes us because he holds the power\nover our career and financial security.
