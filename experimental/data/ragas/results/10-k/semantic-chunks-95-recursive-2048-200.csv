 'Before timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic. There was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still. There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. Making time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face. The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it.

When should you change your toothbrush to ensure effective cleaning?,You should change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility to ensure effective cleaning.,"['Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29). The dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants.'
 '??? note ""TL;DR: Daily actions to keep your teeth healty""\n    * [Brush your teeth](#how-to-brush-your-teeth) after every meal for at least two minutes. * [Floss each day](#how-to-floss) before the last teeth brush. * Use an [electric toothbrush](#manual-versus-electric-tooth-brush). * [Replace the brush](#toothbrush-replacement) each three months or at first\n        sign of wear and tear. * Don\'t eat or drink anything but water after your nightly brush. * [Do not rinse after you brush your teeth](#to-rinse-or-not-to-rinse). * [Use floss instead of a toothpick](#how-to-floss). * [Use mouthwash daily but not after brushing](#mouth-washing). Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one\'s mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis). General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts'
 ""If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities. So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal. Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin. For maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay. At night, you produce less saliva than during the day.""
 ""Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle. When using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes. Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood. ### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility. [1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush. ### To rinse or not to rinse\n\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth. ([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))\n\nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:""
 ""* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums. When you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier. If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly. ## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth. [[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]\n\nChoose a different time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch. And remember not\nto eat or drink for 30 minutes after using a fluoride mouthwash. ## Do yearly check ups\n\nFirst find a dentist that you trust, until you do, search for second and third\noptions before diving into anything you may regret. Once you have it, yearly go to their dreaded places so they can:\n\n* Check that everything is alright. * Do a regular clean, but beware of [unnecessary deep cleaning](teeth_deep_cleaning.md). # References\n\n* [Wikipedia oral hygiene article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene)\n* [CNN health article on oral\n    hygiene](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html)\n[![](not-by-ai.svg){: .center}](https://notbyai.fyi)""
 ""Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks. That's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work. ### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:\n\n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste. * Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\n    to tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\n    massage the gums. For example, start with the upper left part on the\n    outside, reach the other side of your mouth, clean the bottom of your right\n    side teeth, then go back on the inside of each teeth until you arrive to\n    your left side. Try to avoid brushing with too much force as this can\n    damage the surface of your teeth. * Rinse with water. * Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and repeat the cycle. * Brush your tongue. * Spit the extra toothpaste but don't rinse or drink anything in the next 30\n    minutes. The whole process should take at least two minutes. ### Manual versus electric tooth brush\n\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums. The technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention.""
 ""If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference. ### [Keep your brush away from your feces](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAs the [Mythbusters showed](https://mythresults.com/episode12), Fecal coliform\nwere found on toothbrushes stored at the bathroom. And even though none were of\na level high enough to be dangerous, and experts confirm that such bacteria are\nimpossible to completely avoid, you can reduce the risk by:\n\n* Storing the brush in a cupboard or in other room. * Putting a lid on your toothbrush\n* Closing the lid on your toilet seat before flushing. ## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\n\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession. The correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))""

What are the 4 stages linking motivation to habit outcomes?,"The four stages linking motivation to habit outcomes are: Reward, Cue, Cravings, and Response.","['A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. A [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition. When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.'
 'As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"". ## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". You want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off. If you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start. ### Habit stacking'
 ""This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. Mastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance. # How to manage habits\n## Track your habit management\nYou can have a `habits.org` file where you prioritize, analyze, track them. I'm using the next headings:\n\n* *Habits being implemented*: It's subdivided in two:\n  * Habits that need attention\n  * Habits that don't need attention\n* *Unclassified habits*: Useful when refiling habits from your inbox. This list will be analyzed when you do habit analysis. * *Backlog of habits*: Unrefined and unordered list of habits\n* Implemented habits:\n* Rejected habits:\n\nEach habit is a `TODO` item with the usual states: `TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`, `REJECTED`. In it's body I keep a log of the evolution and the analysis of the habit. ## Habit management workflow\n\nEach month I'm trying to go through the list of habits to:\n\n- Update the state of the habits: Some will be done, rejected or to register ideas about them. - Decide which ones need attention.""

 ""Who do you wish to become? As we're more result oriented, another way is to work backwards from them to the person you want to be. Ask yourself: Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want? # How to change a habit\n\nThe process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:\n\n- **Reward** is the end goal. - **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour.""
 'Many behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"". The key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits. - A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency. With these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack. ### Use the environment to tweak your cues'
 ""It's contains the information that predicts a reward. - **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act. - **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it. If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future. We chase rewards because they:\n\n- Deliver contentment. - Satisfy your craving. - Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. If a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop. If we keep these stages in mind then:\n\n- To build good habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it obvious\n    - Craving: Make it attractive\n    - Response: Make it easy\n    - Reward: Make it satisfying\n\n- To break bad habits we need to:\n\n    - Cue: Make it invisible\n    - Craving: Make it unattractive\n    - Response: Make it difficult\n    - Reward: Make it unsatisfying\n\n## Select which habits you want to work with\n\nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be. I find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with.""
 ""Habits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action. If we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through. Temptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time.""
 ""The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. A new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one. When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day. Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else. Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood""

 '* *It can breed hostility*: According to this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely),\n    anonymity often sets off a “witch hunt”, where leaders seek to know the\n    source of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind\n    anonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or\n    leaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as\n    a personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their\n    employees. * *It can be less impactful than attributed feedback*: When using attributed\n    feedback where responses carry the employees’ names, information can be\n    analyzed for relevance and impact.

Being highlighted against the rest of the employees might be seen as\n    a threat, especially by people belonging to a different race, gender,\n    national origin, or other identities than most of their coworkers. * *Feel insecure*: People may distrust their colleagues, because they\n    just arrived at the organization or may have negative past experiences either with\n    them or with similar people.

 ""We recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we'll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don't have to consciously participate in what it's like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality. Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they're really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it's painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won't have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It's also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won't be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn't risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have. #### Heal yourself from FOMO""
 ""The more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won't ever completely go away, we're even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are. Time pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in. Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history. #### Embrace the community constrains""
 ""Moreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture's ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it's scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don't get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. ### Live for today not tomorrow""
 ""All this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. Reality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you've saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.""

How does avoiding food/drink after brushing help fluoride work overnight?,Avoiding food and drink after brushing helps fluoride work overnight by giving it the longest opportunity to act on the teeth without interference from food particles or beverages.,"[""Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.

This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work. ### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:\n\n* Wet the brush but don't add any toothpaste. * Slowly and systematically guide the bristle of the electric brush from tooth\n    to tooth, following the contour of the gums and their crowns, remembering to\n    massage the gums.

The whole process should take at least two minutes. ### Manual versus electric tooth brush\n\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.

Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one\'s mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis). General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts'
 'Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29). The dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants.'
 ""If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities. So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal. Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin. For maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.

 ""* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums. When you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier. If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly. ## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth. [[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]\n\nChoose a different time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch. And remember not\nto eat or drink for 30 minutes after using a fluoride mouthwash. ## Do yearly check ups\n\nFirst find a dentist that you trust, until you do, search for second and third\noptions before diving into anything you may regret.

 ""People in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:\n\n* You’ll get rid of the excess toothpaste along with any food or bacteria that\n    could have been stuck in your teeth or released by the brushing itself. * You’ll also be removing the fluoride from your mouth, which if swallowed,\n    might upset your stomach. People against rinsing your mouth argue that:\n\n* When you rinse with water, you’re potentially washing away any remnants of\n    toothpaste, including the fluoride that makes it work. That could mean that\n    even though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\n    should be. Whilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other. So it's up to\nyou to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Some people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush. Similarly, if you consume a lot of sugar, you should\nprobably avoid rinsing.""

One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.

 ""Moreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture's ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it's scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don't get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it. And it leads to the insight that meaningful efficiency often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take. ### Live for today not tomorrow""
