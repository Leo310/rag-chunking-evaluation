"What two forces influence alertness during an all-nighter, and how do they interact?","[""### All-nighters  \nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure.
