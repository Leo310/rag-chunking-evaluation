What characterizes the deepest stages of NREM sleep?,"[""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.""]","The deepest stages of NREM sleep, which are stages 3 and 4, are characterized by it being more difficult to wake a person up compared to stages 1 and 2.",simple,"[{'h_1': 'Sleep physiological effects', 'h_2': 'The sleep cycle', 'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/sleep.md', 'id': 100}]",True
Which bodily functions does the circadian clock affect?,"[""## The circadian rhythm  \nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay""]","The circadian clock affects several bodily functions, including when you want to be awake or asleep, your timed preferences for eating and drinking, your moods and emotions, the amount of urine you produce, your core body temperature, your metabolic rate, and the release of numerous hormones.",reasoning,"[{'h_1': 'Sleep physiological effects', 'h_2': 'The circadian rhythm', 'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/sleep.md', 'id': 89}]",True

What changes can boost self-control against habits?,"[""Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source.
