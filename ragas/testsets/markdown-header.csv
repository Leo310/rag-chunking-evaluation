What is the difference between a task manager and an action manager?,"[""- `task` -> `action`: Similar to `work` a `task` is something you kind of feel obliged to do. It uses a negative mindset to set the perfect scenario to feel guilty when you fail to do them. But you're on your personal time, it should be fine not to do an action for whatever reason. `Action` on the other side fosters a positive way of thinking, it suggests change, movement in a way that helps you move forward. There are also other derived words such as `task manager` -> `action manager`.""]","The difference between a task manager and an action manager is that a task manager is associated with a negative mindset and feelings of obligation, while an action manager fosters a positive way of thinking and suggests change and movement that helps you move forward.",simple,"[{'h_1': 'Anticapitalist approach to time management', 'h_2': 'Changing the language', 'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/time_management.md', 'id': 172}]",True
What does the American Dental Association recommend regarding the use of dental floss in daily oral hygiene?,"[""## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)  \nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.  \nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))  \n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.""]","The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of one's daily oral hygiene regime, using a different piece of floss at each flossing session.",simple,"[{'h_1': 'How to take care of your teeth', 'h_2': '[How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)', 'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/teeth.md', 'id': 125}]",True
How does your environment shape habits?,"[""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.  \nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.""]","Your environment shapes habits by creating cues that trigger behaviors. Over time, habits become associated with the entire context surrounding the behavior rather than a single trigger.
