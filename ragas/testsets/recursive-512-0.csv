"What are the effects of sleep deprivation on the body and mind, especially regarding adenosine buildup and REM/NREM disruption?","[""But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake. This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm. Unlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake. ### Am I getting enough sleep? When you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt\n\nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation. Other sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence. Of course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder. ## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2. In REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases. ![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)\n\nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM. But as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating. Although there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:\n\n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity. * The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories. * The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\n    which to remove. A key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them. The asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep. A danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues. ## Sleeping time and sense distortions\n\nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too. All these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thal"", ""But that's not true.
