What is the proper technique for flossing to ensure effective cleaning between teeth?,"[""* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\n    with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\n    between the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\n    snap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\n    until you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\n    the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\n    side of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\n    and down motion.\n\nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.\n\nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):\n\n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.\n* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.\n\nWhen you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier.  If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly.\n\n## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth.\n[[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]""]","The proper technique for flossing to ensure effective cleaning between teeth includes wrapping 15–25 cm of floss around your middle fingers, using your thumb and index finger for upper teeth and both index fingers for lower teeth, leaving roughly 2.5 cm between your fingers.

What does FOMO mean for time management?,"['fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have.  \n\n#### Heal yourself from FOMO\nIn practical terms, a limit-embracing attitude to time means organizing your days with the understanding that you definitely won\'t have time for everything you want to do, or that other people want you to do, and so, at the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing. Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all. It also means resisting the temptation to ""keep your options open"" in favour of deliberately making big, daunting, irreversible commitments, which you can\'t know in advance will turn out for the best, but which']",The context does not provide a definition or explanation of what FOMO means for time management.,reasoning,"[{'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/time_management.md', 'id': 136}]",True
