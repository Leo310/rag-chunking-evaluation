What effect does the circadian rhythm have on our desire to sleep and wakefulness?,"[""The distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""]","The circadian rhythm has a descending effect that powers down activity and alertness levels, which triggers a strong desire for sleep.

How do beliefs affect the shift to identity-based habits?,"['- Identity: Changing your beliefs, assumptions and biases: your world view, your self-image, your judgments.  \nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve.

With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.']","Beliefs affect the shift to identity-based habits by influencing our world view, self-image, and judgments.

How does your environment shape habits?,"[""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""]","Your environment shapes habits by associating them with the entire context surrounding the behavior, rather than a single trigger.
