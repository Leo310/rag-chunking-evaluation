How might linking behaviors to cues boost new habit success?,"['Many behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable.

Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year.

What are the effects of improving personal project mgmt. with a focus on goal achievement and effort reduction vs. traditional productivity?,"['---\ntitle: Time management\ndate: 20210524\nauthor: Lyz\n---\n\n[Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness and efficiency. It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person ""choice"" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.\n\nTo be able to do time management, you first need to define how do you want to increase your effectiveness and efficiency. For me, it means increasing the amount and quality of actions per unit of time or effort. Understanding actions as any process that gets me closer to a goal. It shouldn\'t be related with professional work (abajo el trabajo!)but to personal projects, cleaning or hanging out with friends.\n\n# Anticapitalist approach to time management\nTime management is being used to perpetrate the now hegemonic capitalist values. Its a pity because the underlying concepts are pretty useful and interesting but they are oriented towards improving productivity and being able to deal with an increasing amount of work. Basically they\'re always telling you to be a better cog. It doesn\'t matter how good you are, there is always room for improvement. I\'ve fallen on this trap for a long time (I\'m still getting my head out of the hole) and I\'m trying to amend things by applying the concepts on an anticapitalist mindset. The turning point was to read [Four thousand weeks: Time management for mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), the article will have book extracts mixed with my way of thinking.\n\nSome (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person. You need to be at a certai', ""argest amount of change using as little time, energy or effort as possible ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/efficiency) doesn't agree with me though :P. It may be because universities are also another important vector of spreading the capitalist values `:(`). So using efficiency we're focusing more on improving the process itself, so it can be applied for example on how to optimize your enjoyment of doing nothing. Which is completely antagonistic to the concept of productivity.\n\n \n## Changing the mindset\n\nThere is a widespread feeling that we're always short on time. We're obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we're deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time. And it get's worse as you age because time seems to speed up as you get older, steadily accelerating until months begging to flash by in what feels like minutes. \n\nThe real problem isn't our limited time. It's that we've unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one. \n\n### Time is not a resource to spend\n\nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month's milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.\n\nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was""]","The effects of improving personal project management with a focus on goal achievement and effort reduction, as opposed to traditional productivity, are not explicitly detailed in the context provided. However, it suggests that traditional time management often emphasizes productivity and efficiency in a capitalist framework, which may not align with personal goals and enjoyment. The anticapitalist approach encourages a mindset shift away from viewing time as a resource to be spent, promoting a healthier relationship with time that prioritizes personal projects and enjoyment over mere productivity.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/time_management.md', 'id': 51}, {'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/time_management.md', 'id': 53}]",True
