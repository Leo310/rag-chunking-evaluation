What is the significance of plaque removal in maintaining oral health?,"[""Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.\n\nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.\n\nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.\n\nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.\n\nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.\n\n### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:""]","A sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of pathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth, which is significant for maintaining oral health.",simple,"[{'source': 'my_benchmark/documents/teeth.md', 'id': 41}]",True
