What is the significance of plaque removal in maintaining oral health?,"A sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of pathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth, which is significant for maintaining oral health.","[""Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).\n\nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.\n\nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.\n\nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.""
 'Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.\n\nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.'
 ""Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one's mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis).""
 'If you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.\n\nThe technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle.\n\nWhen using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles.\n\n[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.'

One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.""
 'General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.\n\nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.\n\n## Teeth brushing'
 'The correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))\n\n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\n    with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\n    between the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\n    snap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\n    until you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\n    the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\n    side of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\n    and down motion.'

"What NREM neural processes cause sensory blackout, and how does this link to REM sleep?","A key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while REM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The thalamus acts as the sensory gate to the brain, blocking signals from the outside world when you are asleep, which imposes a sensory blackout. This process is linked to REM sleep as the brain requires both NREM and REM sleep to maintain its neural health, with NREM removing unneeded material and REM enhancing details.","[""All these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.""

 'A key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.'

 ""Humans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.\n\nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.\n\n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)""
 ""A danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.\n\n## Sleeping time and sense distortions\n\nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.""
 ""Another consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.\n\n# How your brain generates sleep""

 'As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.\n\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". \n\nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable.
