What are some strategies to increase efficiency in daily life?,"Some strategies to increase efficiency in daily life include adjusting your roadmap, reducing the time spent doing unwanted actions, and improving the way you carry out your actions.","['# How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency.

 'Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.'
 ""Most of the actions or processes we do involve some kind of tool. The better you\nknow how to use them, the better your efficiency will be. The more you use\na tool, the more it's worth the investment of time to improve your usage of it.\n\nWhenever I use a tool, I try to think if I could configure it or use it in a way\nthat will make it easier or quicker. Don't go crazy and try to change everything. Go\nstep by step, and once you've internalized the improvement, implement the next.""
 ""All this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time.""
 ""Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they're really just ways of furthering the avoidance.

Which sleep phase resembles wakefulness in brainwaves?,"REM sleep resembles wakefulness in brainwaves, as the brainwave activity during REM sleep looks similar to that of when you are awake.","['awake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.'
 'Starting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.'
 'Even though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.'
 'In REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake.

 ""When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.""
 'Many behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".'
 ""A new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.""

 'Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.'
 'The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.'
 'As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else.
