What is the significance of chaining small habits in the process of habit stacking?,"The significance of chaining small habits in the process of habit stacking is that once you have mastered the basic structure of tying a new habit to an established one, you can create larger stacks by linking multiple small habits together. This allows for the development of more complex routines based on existing behaviors.","['### Habit stacking  \nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.'
 ""A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.  \nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.  \nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.  \nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.""
 ""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""
 ""## Working with the habit cues  \nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We'll do it by:  \n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)""
 ""# How to change a habit  \nThe process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:  \n- **Reward** is the end goal.\n- **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour. It's contains the information that predicts a reward.\n- **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act.\n- **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.  \nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.  \nWe chase rewards because they:  \n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.  \nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.  \nIf we keep these stages in mind then:  \n- To build good habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it obvious\n- Craving: Make it attractive\n- Response: Make it easy\n- Reward: Make it satisfying  \n- To break bad habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it invisible\n- Craving: Make it unattractive\n- Response: Make it difficult\n- Reward: Make it unsatisfying""
 '# Why are habits interesting  \nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.  \nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.  \nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Habits reduce the cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so they can be carried on with your nonconscious mind and you can allocate your attention to other tasks.'
 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".'
 ""### Align your personal identity change with an existent shared identity  \nWe pick up habits from the people around us. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal one. This transforms your personal identity transformation into the building of a shared one. Shared identities have great benefits over single ones:  \n- They foster belonging. A powerful feeling that creates motivation.\n- They are more resilient: When one falters others will take their place so all together you'll guarantee the maintenance of the identity.\n- They create friendship and community\n- They expose you to an environment where more habits tied to that identity thrive.  \nLikewise, if you're trying to run from a bad habit cut your ties to communities that embrace that habit.""
 ""## Working with the habit cravings  \n### Temptation bundling  \nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that can be used as the scientific measurement of craving. For years we assumed that it was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion and voluntary movement.  \nHabits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action.  \nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through.  \nTemptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time. In the end you may even look forward to do the habit you need as it's related to the habit you want.""

What are the consequences of treating time as a resource?,"The consequences of treating time as a resource include feeling pressure to use it efficiently, leading to self-beratement for perceived waste. This mindset can bind one's sense of self-worth to time management, making it difficult to simply live in the moment. It creates a rigged game where one never feels they are doing well enough, causing a focus on future goals rather than present experiences. Ultimately, it can lead to a life spent worrying about the future and makes it hard to experience the flow of life.","['The next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.  \nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.  \nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".  \nUltimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.'
 ""### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou'll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it's daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can't as much as you can't tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can.""
 '### Time is not a resource to spend  \nBefore timetables life rhythms emerged organically from the tasks they needed to do. You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time. Anyone who would tried imposing an external schedule on any of that, for example, doing a month\'s milking in a single day to get it out of the way would rightly have been considered a lunatic.  \nThere was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life. In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time ""ticking away"" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.  \nThere\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented.  \nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.'
 ""### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won't ever completely go away, we're even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are.  \nTime pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.  \nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.""
 '# Anticapitalist approach to time management\nTime management is being used to perpetrate the now hegemonic capitalist values. Its a pity because the underlying concepts are pretty useful and interesting but they are oriented towards improving productivity and being able to deal with an increasing amount of work. Basically they\'re always telling you to be a better cog. It doesn\'t matter how good you are, there is always room for improvement. I\'ve fallen on this trap for a long time (I\'m still getting my head out of the hole) and I\'m trying to amend things by applying the concepts on an anticapitalist mindset. The turning point was to read [Four thousand weeks: Time management for mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals), the article will have book extracts mixed with my way of thinking.  \nSome (or most) of what\'s written in this article may not apply if you\'re not a male, white, young, cis, hetero, European, university graduated, able-bodied, """"""wealthy"""""" person. You need to be at a certain level of the social ladder to even start thinking in these terms. And depending on the number of oppressions you\'re suffering you\'ll have more or less room to maneuver. That margin is completely outside our control so by no means we should feel guilty of not being able to manage time. What follows are just guidelines to deal with this time anxiety imposed by the capitalist system with whatever air we have to breath.'
 ""### If you don't disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse  \nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time.  \nReality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you've saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.  \nIt also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It's somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.""
 '---\ntitle: Time management\ndate: 20210524\nauthor: Lyz\n---  \n[Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness and efficiency. It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person ""choice"" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.  \nTo be able to do time management, you first need to define how do you want to increase your effectiveness and efficiency. For me, it means increasing the amount and quality of actions per unit of time or effort. Understanding actions as any process that gets me closer to a goal. It shouldn\'t be related with professional work (abajo el trabajo!)but to personal projects, cleaning or hanging out with friends.'
 ""## Changing the mindset  \nThere is a widespread feeling that we're always short on time. We're obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we're deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time. And it get's worse as you age because time seems to speed up as you get older, steadily accelerating until months begging to flash by in what feels like minutes.  \nThe real problem isn't our limited time. It's that we've unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. What follows are a list of mindset changes from the traditional time management bibliography that can set the bases of a healthier Anticapitalist one.""
 '# How to manage time  \nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life.  \nTo increase the efficiency we can:  \n* [Adjust your roadmap](#adjust-your-roadmap)\n* [Reduce the time spent doing unwanted actions](#reduce-the-time-spent-doing-unwanted-actions).\n* [Improve the way you carry out your actions](#improve-the-way-you-carry-out-your-actions).\n* [Improve how you manage your tools](#improve-how-you-manage-your-tools).\n* [Improve your state and environment to be more efficient](#improve-your-state-and-environment-to-be-more-efficient).'
 ""### Embrace the finitude of time  \nWe recoil from the notion that this is it. That *this life*, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it  unfolds, is the only one we'll get a shot at. Instead, we mentally fight against the way things are, so that we don't have to consciously participate in what it's like to feel claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality.  \nOur troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they're really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it's painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won't have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It's also painful to accept the limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won't be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn't risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have.""]",0.9888888888779013,1.0

 ""Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time.

 '### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change  \nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"".  \nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.  \nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year.

 ""# Consequences of lack of sleep  \nSleeping less than six or seven hours a night can produce these consequences:  \n* Demolishing of the immune system.\n* Doubling your risk of cancer.\n* Is a key lifestyle factor determining and worsening the development of the Alzheimer's\ndisease.\n* Disruption of blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as\npre-diabetic.\n* Increase the likelihood of block and brittle of your coronary arteries.\nSetting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive\nheart failure.\n* Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression,\nanxiety, and suicidality.\n* Swelling concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while\nsuppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction.\n* Thwart the ability to learn and memorize.  \nA balanced diet and exercise are of vital importance, but we now see sleep as\nthe key factor in health. The physical and mental impairments caused by one\nnight of bad sleep dwarf those caused by an equivalent absence of food or\nexercise.  \nTherefore, **the shorter you sleep, the shorter your life span**.""
 ""## Sleeping time and sense distortions  \nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.  \nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.  \nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.""
 ""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from""
 ""## The circadian rhythm  \nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.  \nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:  \n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\nsuggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\ntimezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\npopulation.  \nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:  \n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\nsleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\nfunction optimally at this time of day.""
 ""and the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.  \nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects  \nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:  \n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\nthe ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\nsleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.'

 ""## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure  \nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.  \nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 ""### Am I getting enough sleep?  \nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt  \nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.  \nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.  \nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.""]",0.9472222222103819,1.0

How do specific cues in habits help with distractions and behavior change?,"Specific cues in habits help with distractions and behavior change by being highly specific and immediately actionable, which allows individuals to say no to things that derail progress and distract their attention. This specificity helps in formulating habits clearly, leading to the urge to perform the desired behavior at the right time and place, thus facilitating effective behavior change.","[""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""
 ""## Working with the habit cues  \nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We'll do it by:  \n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)""
 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".'
 '### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change  \nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"".  \nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.  \nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.'
 ""Even if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.""
 ""# How to change a habit  \nThe process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:  \n- **Reward** is the end goal.\n- **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour. It's contains the information that predicts a reward.\n- **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act.\n- **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.  \nIf a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.  \nWe chase rewards because they:  \n- Deliver contentment.\n- Satisfy your craving.\n- Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.  \nIf a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.  \nIf we keep these stages in mind then:  \n- To build good habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it obvious\n- Craving: Make it attractive\n- Response: Make it easy\n- Reward: Make it satisfying  \n- To break bad habits we need to:  \n- Cue: Make it invisible\n- Craving: Make it unattractive\n- Response: Make it difficult\n- Reward: Make it unsatisfying""
 ""A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.  \nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.  \nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.  \nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.""
 '# Why are habits interesting  \nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.  \nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.  \nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Habits reduce the cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so they can be carried on with your nonconscious mind and you can allocate your attention to other tasks.'
 '### Habit stacking  \nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.'

They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from""
 ""and the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.  \nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.""
 ""## Sleeping time and sense distortions  \nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.  \nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.  \nAnother consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.""

 ""## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure  \nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.  \nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 ""# Sleep benefits  \nWe sleep for a lot of nighttime benefits that service both our brains and our\nbody. There does not seem to be one major organ within the body, or process\nwithin the brain, that isn't optimally enhanced by sleep.  \nWithin the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical\ndecisions and choices. It recalibrates our emotional brain circuits, allowing us\nto navigate next day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed\ncomposture.  \nDownstairs in the body, sleep:  \n* Restocks the armory of our immune system: helping fight malignancy, preventing\ninfection, and warding off sickness.\n* Reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and\ncirculating glucose.\n* Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food\nselection rather than rash impulsivity.\n* Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut essential to our\nnutritional health being.\n* Is tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure\nwhile keeping our hearts in fine condition.  \nDreaming produces a neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and\na virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge,\ninspiring creativity.  \nTherefore, **Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our\nbrain and body health each day**.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects  \nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:  \n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\nthe ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\nsleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.'
 '## Sleep pressure  \nWhile you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One\nconsequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the\ndesire to sleep by turning down the ""volume"" of wake promoting regions in the\nbrain and turning up the sleep inducing ones. Most people fall to the pressure\nafter twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.'
 ""### All-nighters  \nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""]",0.9166666666361111,1.0

How to manage tasks amid interruptions?,"To manage tasks amid interruptions, it is recommended to minimize context switches and focus on fewer processes, ideally less than three.

If no steps are available, refer to the day plan to initiate the next action.","[""### [Interruption management](interruption_management.md)  \nWe've come to accept that we need to be available 24/7 and answer immediately,\nthat makes us slaves of the interruptions, it drives our attention and personal\nrelations.

Most of the times interruptions can wait 20 or 60\nminutes, and many of them can be avoided with better action and time planning.  \nInterruptions are one of the main flow killers. Not only they\nunexpectedly break your flow, they also add undesired mental load as you are\nwaiting for them to happen, and need to check them often.

 ""### Meetings  \nCalls, video calls, group calls or physical meetings are the best communication\nchannel to transmit non trivial short messages. Even if they are the most\nefficient, they will break your focus, as you'll need to prepare\nyourself to know what to say and how, go to the meeting location, and then\nprocess all the information gathered. That's why if not used wisely, it can be\na sink of efficiency.  \nTry to minimize and group the meetings, thus having less interruptions. Maximize\nthe continuous uninterrupted time, so schedule them at the start or end of the\nmorning or afternoon.  \nOnce you agreed to attend, make each of them count. Define an agenda and a time\nlimit per section. That'll keep the conversation on track, and will give enough\ninformation to the attendees to decide if they need to be there. Likewise,\nwhenever you're invited to a meeting, value if you need to go. If you don't,\npolitely decline the offer. Sometimes assigning someone the role to conduct the\nmeeting, or taking turns to talk can help.  \nThere are more informal meetings where you don't need all these constrains and\nformality. For example in a coffee break. You know that they are going to be\nunproductive but that's ok too. Master your tools and apply them where you think\nthey are needed.""
 ""### Minimize the context switches  \nEach time we switch from one action to another, the brain needs to load all the\nnecessary information to be able to address the new action.

 ""### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets. But the more you confront the facts of finitude instead, and work with them, rather than against them, the more efficient, meaningful and joyful life becomes. Anxiety won't ever completely go away, we're even limited, apparently, in our capacity to embrace our limitations. But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are.  \nTime pressure comes largely from forces outside our control: from a cutthroat economy; from the loss of the social safety networks that used to help ease the burdens of work and childcare; and from the sexist expectation that women must excel in their careers while assuming most of the responsibilities at home. None of that will be solved with time management. Fully facing the reality of it can only help though. So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaboration with those demands. Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll stop believing the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction and will be newly empowered to resist them, letting you focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in.  \nSeeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.""
