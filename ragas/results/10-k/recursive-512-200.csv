What defines sleep as a naturally recurring state of mind and body?,"Sleep is defined as a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity, and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, along with reduced interactions with surroundings. It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli.","['Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical\ndecisions and choices.

What's the mindset for seeing time as flow?,"The mindset for seeing time as flow involves living in deep time, where one experiences a heightened awareness of the vividness of things and a feeling of timelessness. This perspective contrasts with the modern view of time as a resource to be spent and emphasizes organic life rhythms rather than imposed schedules.","['a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.'
 'Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.'
 'Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place.

"How does repeating behaviors in the same context boost habit automaticity, and what does this mean for managing habits?","When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action, which increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. This means that the more often a behavior is performed in the same context, the more automatic it becomes, characterized by features such as efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. For managing habits, this implies that consistently practicing behaviors in the same environment can help in forming new habits and making them automatic over time.","['When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.
