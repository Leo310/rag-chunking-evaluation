"How does sleepiness change post-caffeine metabolism, factoring in adenosine buildup and age?","Post-caffeine metabolism leads to a significant change in sleepiness due to the accumulation of adenosine while caffeine is present. Once the liver dismantles the caffeine, the accumulated adenosine causes a vicious backlash of sleepiness, which can be more pronounced in older individuals as it takes longer for their brain and body to remove caffeine. This results in a rapid plummet in energy levels and difficulty in functioning and concentrating, accompanied by a strong sense of sleepiness.","['Age is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.  \nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*.

What env. tweaks and timing help with habit formation?,"To help with habit formation, you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. Additionally, being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it, such as formulating your habits as 'I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]', can aid in timing and execution.","[""When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.""
 ""Mastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.""
 'The cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"".'
 ""## Working with the habit cues  \nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We'll do it by:  \n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)""
 '### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.'
 '## Working with the habit responses'
 'Habits are a dopamine-driven feed back loop. It is released not only when you receive a reward but also when you anticipate it. This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action.  \nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through.'
 ""You want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.  \nIf you aren't sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.""
