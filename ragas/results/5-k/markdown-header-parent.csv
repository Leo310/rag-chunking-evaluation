What techniques are recommended for effective plaque removal using a manual toothbrush?,"For effective plaque removal using a manual toothbrush, it is recommended to use a toothbrush with a small head and soft bristles, and to employ a systematic approach rather than back and forth brushing, as this is not effective at the gum line.","['# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### Manual versus electric tooth brush\nIf you want to use a manual one, Oral health professionals recommend the use of\na tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in\nremoving plaque without damaging the gums.  \nThe technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease\nprevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle.  \nWhen using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles.  \n[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes.  \nRegardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.'
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).  \nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.  \nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.  \nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.  \nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.  \nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.  \nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.  \nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.  \nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight.

 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)\nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums.

How do adenosine levels and circadian rhythm affect alertness post sleep deprivation?,"Adenosine levels continue to rise when you remain awake, which typically would make you feel sleepier. However, despite feeling increasingly sleepy throughout the night, alertness begins to improve after hitting a low point around five or six in the morning due to the energy return of the circadian rhythm, which operates independently of sleep pressure.","[""# Sleep physiological effects\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.  \nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\n### Am I getting enough sleep?\nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt  \nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.  \nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.  \nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects\n## Sleep pressure\n### Caffeine\nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively\ninactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.  \nLevels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is\nproblematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes\nbetween five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration\nfrom your body.  \nAn enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.  \nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to\nfunction and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.  \nFor the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on\nbuilding up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging\nchemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.\nOnce your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you\nare hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before\nyou drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated\nin the hours in between.'
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\n### All-nighters\nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""
 ""# Sleep physiological effects\n## The circadian rhythm\nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.  \nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:  \n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\nsuggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\ntimezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\npopulation.  \nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:  \n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\nsleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\nfunction optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\nthe following morning, or even in the afternoon.\n* *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\nleaning towards eveningness.""]",0.99999999998,1.0

It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis).  \nGeneral guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.  \nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.'
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).  \nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.  \nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.  \nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.  \nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.  \nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.  \nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.  \nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.  \nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.""
 ""# How to take care of your teeth\n## Teeth brushing\n### To rinse or not to rinse\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth. ([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))  \nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:  \n* Youâ€™ll get rid of the excess toothpaste along with any food or bacteria that\ncould have been stuck in your teeth or released by the brushing itself.\n* Youâ€™ll also be removing the fluoride from your mouth, which if swallowed,\nmight upset your stomach.  \nPeople against rinsing your mouth argue that:  \n* When you rinse with water, youâ€™re potentially washing away any remnants of\ntoothpaste, including the fluoride that makes it work. That could mean that\neven though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\nshould be.  \nWhilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other. So it's up to\nyou to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  \nSome people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, itâ€™s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush.  Similarly, if you consume a lot of sugar, you should\nprobably avoid rinsing.

What time and place cues help in habit change?,"The cues that can trigger a habit can come in a wide range of forms, but the two most common are time and location.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"".  \nYou want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.  \nIf you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.'
 ""# How to change a habit\n## Working with the habit cues\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We'll do it by:  \n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)""
 ""# How to change a habit\n## Working with the habit cues\n### Use the environment to tweak your cues\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.  \nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.""
 '# How to change a habit\n## Working with the habit cues\n### Habit stacking\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one. You can use this connection to build new habits based on your established ones. This may be called habit stacking. The formulation in this case is ""After [current habit], I will [new habit]"".  \nThe key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one.  \nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:  \n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.  \nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.'
 '# How to change a habit\n## Select which habits you want to work with\nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".']",0.99999999998,1.0
How does the core aid stability and adaptability in Pilates?,"The core, or powerhouse, consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back, and hips, is thought to be the key to a person's stability in Pilates. This stability allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty and intensity can be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises.","[""---\ntitle: Pilates\ndate: 20210211\nauthor: Lyz\n---  \n[Pilates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates) is a physical fitness system\nbased on controlled movements putting emphasis on alignment, breathing,\ndeveloping a strong core, and improving coordination and balance. The core (or\npowerhouse), consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back, and hips, is\nthought to be the key to a person's stability.  \nPilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of\ndifficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of\nthe instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations. Intensity\ncan be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises.  \nYou can think of yoga, but without the spiritual aspects.""
 ""# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n## Flow\nPilates aims for elegant economy of movement, creating flow through the use of\nappropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are\nintended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and\nstamina.  \nA smoothly doing a roll down (from seated position with your legs straight, slowly lay\ndown, vertebrae by vertebrae) is a difficult challenge, as you need every muscle\nto coordinate to share the load of the weight. The muscles that we use more are\nstronger, and some of them are barely used, Pilates positions and slow\ntransitions force you to use those weak, forgotten muscles, and when the load is\ntransferred from the strong to the weak, your body starts shaking or breaks the\nmovement rate thus breaking the flow.  \nEven though it looks silly, it's tough.""
 '# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n## Stamina\nStamina is increased through the gradual strengthening of your body, and with\nthe increasing precision of the motion, making them more efficient so there is\nless stress to perform the exercises.'
 ""# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n## Postural alignment\nBeing more aware of your body by bringing to it's limits with each exercise,\nseeing where it fails, strengthening the weak muscles and practicing flow and\ncontrol results in a better postural alignment.""
 '# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)\n## Breathing\nThe breathing in Pilates is meant the to be deeper, with full inhalations and\ncomplete exhalations. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up. When\ninhaling you need to maintain this engagement to keep the core in control.  \nThe difficult part comes when you try to properly coordinate this\nbreathing practice with the exercise movement, breathes out with the\neffort and in on the return.  \nThis technique is important as it increases the intake of oxygen and the circulation\nof this oxygenated blood to every part of the body, cleaning and\ninvigorating it.']",0.8666666666377778,1.0
