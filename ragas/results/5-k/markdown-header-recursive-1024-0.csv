Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.  \nWe chase rewards because they:""
 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with. As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"".'
 ""The first path of change is doomed because maintaining behaviours that are incongruent with the self is expensive and will not last. Even if they make rational sense. Thus it's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behaviour. On the other hand it's easy to find motivation once a habit has changed your identity as you may be proud of it and will be willing to maintain all the habits and systems associated with it. For example: The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.  \nFocusing on outcomes may also bring the next problems:  \n- Focusing on the results may lead you to temporal solutions. If you focus on the source of the issue at hand you may solve it with less effort and get you to a more stable one.""]",0.99999999998,1.0
How does focus impact workout movements?,The answer to given question is not present in context,"['## Concentration  \nIt demands intense focus, as you need to be aware of the position of each part\nof your body, and how they move to precisely do the exercise.'
 ""## Control  \nYou don't see many quick movements, most of the exercises are anaerobic. The\ndifficult relies on controlling your muscles to do what you want them to while\nthey fight against gravity, springs and other torture tools.""
 ""## Postural alignment  \nBeing more aware of your body by bringing to it's limits with each exercise,\nseeing where it fails, strengthening the weak muscles and practicing flow and\ncontrol results in a better postural alignment.""
 '## Precision  \nThe focus is on doing one precise and perfect movement, rather than many\nhalfhearted ones. The goal is for this precision to eventually become second\nnature and carry over into everyday life as grace and economy of movement.'
 '# Where to focus when changing our habits  \n## Identity focused changes  \nChanging our habits is challenging because we try to change the wrong thing in the wrong way.  \nThere are three levels at which change can occur:  \n- Outcomes: Changing your results. Goals fall under this category: publishing a book, run daily\n- Process: Changing your habits and systems: decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation practice.\n- Identity: Changing your beliefs, assumptions and biases: your world view, your self-image, your judgments.  \nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.']",0.0,1.0
What key factors are assessed in retrospectives to improve team effectiveness and their impact on sprint planning?,"In retrospectives, key factors assessed to improve team effectiveness include individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done and Ready.
