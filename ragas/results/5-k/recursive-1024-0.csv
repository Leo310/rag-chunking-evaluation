What is the significance of plaque removal in maintaining oral health?,"A sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of pathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth, which is significant for maintaining oral health.","[""Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).\n\nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants.

What time and place cues help in habit formation?,The two most common cues that can trigger a habit are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you to say no to distractions and stay on course. Formulating your habits as 'I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]' makes the cue highly specific and immediately actionable.,"[""When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.\n\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""
