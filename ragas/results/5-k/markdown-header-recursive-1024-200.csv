What effect does the circadian rhythm have on our desire to sleep and wakefulness?,"The circadian rhythm has a descending effect that powers down activity and alertness levels, which triggers a strong desire for sleep. As the circadian activity rhythm returns after sleep, it begins to energize and naturally wake us up.","[""## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure  \nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.  \n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)  \nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.  \nNow let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have\nonly been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations\nhave increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its\npowerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.""
 ""## The circadian rhythm  \nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:  \n* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.  \nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:  \n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\nmaintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\naverage of 24 hours and 15 minutes.  \nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay""
 ""powerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output\nfrom the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in\na delightful sensation of being wide awake.  \nThe distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your\ndesire to sleep.  \nBy eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in\nhigh concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is\ndescending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful\ncombination triggers a strong desire for sleep.  \nDuring sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the\nchance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the\nadenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian\nactivity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,\ntherefore naturally waking us up.""
 '# Sleep physiological effects  \nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:  \n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\nthe ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\nsleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.'
 ""### All-nighters  \nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""]",0.99999999998,1.0

 '# [Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates#Principles)  \n## Breathing  \nThe breathing in Pilates is meant the to be deeper, with full inhalations and\ncomplete exhalations. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up. When\ninhaling you need to maintain this engagement to keep the core in control.  \nThe difficult part comes when you try to properly coordinate this\nbreathing practice with the exercise movement, breathes out with the\neffort and in on the return.  \nThis technique is important as it increases the intake of oxygen and the circulation\nof this oxygenated blood to every part of the body, cleaning and\ninvigorating it.'

How do beliefs affect the shift to identity-based habits?,"Beliefs affect the shift to identity-based habits by influencing our world view, self-image, and judgments. When changing habits, focusing on who we wish to become, rather than just the outcomes we want to achieve, is essential.","[""### Align your personal identity change with an existent shared identity  \nWe pick up habits from the people around us. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal one. This transforms your personal identity transformation into the building of a shared one. Shared identities have great benefits over single ones:  \n- They foster belonging. A powerful feeling that creates motivation.\n- They are more resilient: When one falters others will take their place so all together you'll guarantee the maintenance of the identity.\n- They create friendship and community\n- They expose you to an environment where more habits tied to that identity thrive.  \nLikewise, if you're trying to run from a bad habit cut your ties to communities that embrace that habit.""
 '## Changing your identity  \nWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.  \nYour habits and systems are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. The more you repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour. To the point that your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.  \nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.'
 '# Where to focus when changing our habits  \n## Identity focused changes  \nChanging our habits is challenging because we try to change the wrong thing in the wrong way.  \nThere are three levels at which change can occur:  \n- Outcomes: Changing your results. Goals fall under this category: publishing a book, run daily\n- Process: Changing your habits and systems: decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation practice.\n- Identity: Changing your beliefs, assumptions and biases: your world view, your self-image, your judgments.  \nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.'
 'Once you start the ball rolling things become easier as building habits is a feedback loop. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.  \nThe most practical way to change the identity is to:  \n- [Decide the type of person you want to be](#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)\n- Prove it to yourself with small wins  \nAnother advantage of focusing in what type of person you want to be is that maybe the outcome you wanted to focus on is not the wisest smallest step to achieve your identity change. Thinking on the identity you want to embrace can make you think outside the box.'
 ""The first path of change is doomed because maintaining behaviours that are incongruent with the self is expensive and will not last. Even if they make rational sense. Thus it's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behaviour. On the other hand it's easy to find motivation once a habit has changed your identity as you may be proud of it and will be willing to maintain all the habits and systems associated with it. For example: The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.  \nFocusing on outcomes may also bring the next problems:  \n- Focusing on the results may lead you to temporal solutions. If you focus on the source of the issue at hand you may solve it with less effort and get you to a more stable one.""]",0.99999999998,1.0
How does your environment shape habits?,"Your environment shapes habits by associating them with the entire context surrounding the behavior, rather than a single trigger. The environment acts as an invisible hand that influences behaviors, and rearranging it can create visual cues that draw attention to desired habits. Once a habit is encoded, the urge to act is triggered by the reappearance of environmental cues, which can reinforce both good and bad habits.","[""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.""
 ""When building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.""
 'A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.  \nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.  \nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.'

 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with.

The decision is made with the information gathered in the\nrefinement, retro and review sessions.  \nConducted by the scrum master, usually only the members of the scrum team\n(developers, product owner and scrum master) are present, but stakeholders can\nalso be invited.  \nIf the job has been done in the previous sessions, the backlog should be\npriorized and refined, so we should only add the newest issues gathered in the\nretro and review, refine them and decide what we want to do this sprint.  \nThe meeting goes as follows:  \n* We add the issues raised in the review to the backlog.\n* We analyze the tasks on the top of the backlog, add them to the sprint\nboard without assigning it to any developer.\n* Once all tasks are added, we the stats of past sprints to see if the scope is\nrealistic.  \nThe goals of the meeting are:""
 '* Get the feedback from the stakeholders. We expect to gather and process their\nfeedback by processing their opinions both of the work done of the past\nsprint and the work to be done in the next one. It will be gathered by the\nscrum master and persisted in the board on the planning meetings.  \n* Incorporate the stakeholders in the decision making process of the team. By\ninviting them to define with the rest of the scrum team the tasks for the\nnext sprint.'
 '# The meetings  \nScrum tries to minimize the time spent in meetings while keeping a clearly\ndefined direction and a healthy environment between all the people involved in\nthe project.  \nTo achieve that is uses four types of meetings:  \n* [Daily](#daily-meetings).\n* [Refinement](#refinement-meetings).\n* [Retros](#retro-meetings).\n* [Reviews](#review-meetings).\n* [Plannings](#planning-meetings).'
 'The meeting consists of five phases, all of them conducted by the scrum master:  \n* *Set the stage*: There is an opening dynamic to give people time to “arrive”\nand get into the right mood.\n* *Gather Data*: Help everyone remember. Create a shared pool of information\n(everybody sees the world differently). There is an initial dynamic to\nmeasure the general feeling of the team and the issues to analyze further.\n* *Generate insights*: Analyze why did things happen the way they did, identify\npatterns and see the big picture.\n* *Decide what to do*: Pick a few issues to work on and create concrete action\nplans of how you’ll address them. Adding the as issues in the scrum board.\n* *Close the retrospective*: Clarify follow-ups, show appreciations, leave the\nmeeting with a general good feeling, and analyze how could the\nretrospectives improve.  \nIf you have no idea how to conduct this meeting, you can take ideas from\n[retromat](https://retromat.org).  \nThe goals of the meeting are:'
 ""* Arrange, prepare and conduct the planning meeting:\n* Make sure that you've done the required refinement sessions to have the\ntasks and Kanban board ready for the next sprint.\n* Create the planning calendar event inviting the members of the scrum team.\n* Conduct the planning meeting.\n* Update the tasks with the outcome of the meeting and start the sprint.""]",0.99999999998,1.0
