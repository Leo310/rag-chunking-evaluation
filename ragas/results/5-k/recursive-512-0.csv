What are some strategies to increase efficiency in daily life?,"Some strategies to increase efficiency in daily life include adjusting your roadmap, reducing the time spent doing unwanted actions, and improving the way you carry out your actions.","['# How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life.\n\nTo increase the efficiency we can:'
 'be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.'
 'Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.'
 ""Most of the actions or processes we do involve some kind of tool. The better you\nknow how to use them, the better your efficiency will be. The more you use\na tool, the more it's worth the investment of time to improve your usage of it.\n\nWhenever I use a tool, I try to think if I could configure it or use it in a way\nthat will make it easier or quicker. Don't go crazy and try to change everything. Go\nstep by step, and once you've internalized the improvement, implement the next.""
 ""All this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time.""]",0.6999999999766667,0.3333333333333333
What strategies can be employed to reduce wasted time in our daily activities?,"One strategy to reduce wasted time in daily activities is to minimize context switches, as each switch requires the brain to load new information and can be time-consuming and exhausting. Therefore, it is important to switch actions consciously and sparingly.","['Time management used this way serves as a distraction to numb our minds:'

Which sleep phase resembles wakefulness in brainwaves?,"REM sleep resembles wakefulness in brainwaves, as the brainwave activity during REM sleep looks similar to that of when you are awake.","['awake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.'
 'Starting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with\nan alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it\nbuilds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian\nrhythm peaks.'
 'Even though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.'
 'In REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.\n\n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)'
