What is the significance of minimizing context switches in managing time effectively?,"The significance of minimizing context switches in managing time effectively lies in reducing the toll that context switching takes on productivity. By managing actions well, the negative impact of switching contexts can be minimized, allowing for more efficient work processes and less time lost.","['For example, if you keep on going back to the email client regularly even though\nyou decided only to check it three times a day, instead of mentally punishing\nyourself when you check it, close the client or move it elsewhere so\nit\'s not where you use to see it.\n\n### Don\'t wait, switch actions\n\nEven though we want to [minimize the context\nswitches](#minimize-the-context-switches), staring at the screen for a long\nprocess to end makes no sense. If you do [action management](action_management.md)\nwell, the context switch toll gets smaller enough that whenever you hit a block\nin the action you\'re focusing on, you can switch to another one.

Try to have as less processes as possible, less than three if\npossible. If there is only one active process, look at the [action\nplan](life_planning.md#action-plan) for the next step that could be done in\nparallel. As both processes act on the context of the same action, the switch is cheap.

 ""# How to manage time\n\nThe rest of the article describes the approaches I use to apply this idea of efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life.\n\nTo increase the efficiency we can:\n\n* [Adjust your roadmap](#adjust-your-roadmap)\n* [Reduce the time spent doing unwanted actions](#reduce-the-time-spent-doing-unwanted-actions).\n* [Improve the way you carry out your actions](#improve-the-way-you-carry-out-your-actions).\n* [Improve how you manage your tools](#improve-how-you-manage-your-tools).\n* [Improve your state and environment to be more efficient](#improve-your-state-and-environment-to-be-more-efficient).\n\n## Adjust your roadmap\n\nTo be able to efficiently use your time and energy you need to identify where and how to do it given your current circumstances. [Roadmap adjustment](roadmap_adjustment.md) gathers the techniques to make and review plans in order to define that optimal path.\n## Reduce the time spent doing unwanted actions\n\nSadly, the day has *only* 24 hours you can use. There's nothing to do about it,\nwe can however reduce the amount of wasted time to make a better use of the one\nwe have.\n\n### Minimize the context switches\n\nEach time we switch from one action to another, the brain needs to load all the\nnecessary information to be able to address the new action. Dumping the old one's\ninformation and loading the new is both time consuming and exhausting, so do it\nconsciously and sparingly.\n\nOne way of improving this behaviour is by using the [Pomodoro\ntechnique](life_planning.md).\n\n### [Interruption management](interruption_management.md)""
 ""Ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hoped-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. And it makes it all but impossible to experience *the flow*, that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.\n\n### Time is not a resource to be tamed\nYou'll see everywhere the concept of `time management`. I feel it's daring to suggest that you have the power to actually manage time. No you can't as much as you can't tame the sea. [Time is not a resource to be spent or be managed](#time-is-not-a-resource-to-be-spent), the best we can do is to try to understand its flows and navigate it the best we can. \n\n### If you don't disavow capitalism an increase in efficiency will only make things worse\n\nAll this context makes us eager to believe the promises of time management frameworks (like [GTD](gtd.md)) that if you improve your efficiency you'll get more time to enjoy your life. If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time. \n\nReality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you've saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up.

Why is anonymous feedback better for new hires than attributed feedback?,Anonymous feedback is considered better for new hires because it allows them to maintain a neutral stance and feel more comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues without the fear of negative repercussions.,"[""A formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the\n    superficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without\n    mentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that\n    no one talks about because they know they are so important that they could\n    stir things up.\n\n    In fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be\n    brought to the table as soon as possible. They should be addressed by the\n    entire team before they become a source of unhappiness, conflict and lack of\n    productivity.\n\n    An anonymous feedback instrument gives you real power over those issues\n    because it doesn't matter who brought it up, but that it’s resolved. For\n    a manager, that insight is invaluable.\n\n* *It builds trust*: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management\n    reacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and\n    sometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied\n    and build up self esteem.\n\n* *It offers a sense of security*: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and\n    creates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions.\n\n* *It allows every voice to be heard and respected*: In workplaces, where they\n    practice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some\n    voices over others. Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher\n    authority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention.\n    In such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate\n    attention than those raised by the rest of the group. However, when feedback\n    is collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus\n    entirely on the feedback.""
 '* *It encourages new employees to share their opinions*:\n    [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0893318905279191)\n    has shown that new employees, who happen to be less senior or influential,\n    see anonymous feedback as more appropriate for formal and informal\n    evaluations than their older colleagues. Typically, the last thing a new\n    employee wants is to start on the wrong foot, so they maintain a neutral\n    stance. Using anonymous feedback can make new employees feel\n    more comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues.\n\nCons of Anonymous Feedback:\n\n* *It can breed hostility*: According to this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/can-your-employees-really-speak-freely),\n    anonymity often sets off a “witch hunt”, where leaders seek to know the\n    source of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind\n    anonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or\n    leaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as\n    a personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their\n    employees.\n\n* *It can be less impactful than attributed feedback*: When using attributed\n    feedback where responses carry the employees’ names, information can be\n    analyzed for relevance and impact. However, with anonymous feedback, it can\n    be difficult to analyze information accurately. It is not uncommon for\n    companies who choose to practice anonymous feedback, to find less specific\n    responses since details may reveal respondents’ identities. Vague feedback\n    from employees would have less power to influence behaviors or drive change\n    in the organization.\n\n* *It can be difficult to act on*: Since anonymous feedback is often difficult\n    to trace, it can be challenging for the organization to get context or\n    follow up on important issues, especially when a problem is peculiar to an\n    individual.\n\n# How to request anonymous feedback'

Maximize\nthe continuous uninterrupted time, so schedule them at the start or end of the\nmorning or afternoon.\n\nOnce you agreed to attend, make each of them count. Define an agenda and a time\nlimit per section. That'll keep the conversation on track, and will give enough\ninformation to the attendees to decide if they need to be there. Likewise,\nwhenever you're invited to a meeting, value if you need to go. If you don't,\npolitely decline the offer. Sometimes assigning someone the role to conduct the\nmeeting, or taking turns to talk can help.\n\nThere are more informal meetings where you don't need all these constrains and\nformality.

 'There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. \n\nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'

 ""Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.\n\nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.\n\nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.\n\nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.\n\nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.\n\n### How to brush your teeth\n\nThe procedure I'm using right now is:""
 ""Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.\n\n### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility.\n[1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush.\n\n### To rinse or not to rinse\n\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth.

That could mean that\n    even though you are brushing your teeth, it might not be as effective as it\n    should be.\n\nWhilst there have been studies on the effectiveness of rinsing, the results only\nindicate that there COULD be an advantage of one over the other.

 ""Some people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush.

If you don't fit into these categories, then it’s really\nbased on your own preference.\n\n### [Keep your brush away from your feces](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAs the [Mythbusters showed](https://mythresults.com/episode12), Fecal coliform\nwere found on toothbrushes stored at the bathroom.

One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.\n\nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))""
 ""General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.\n\nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.\n\n## Teeth brushing\n\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).\n\nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.\n\nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.\n\nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.\n\nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.""]",0.8874999999778125,1.0
How does sleep affect metabolism and cognitive function?,"Sleep affects metabolism by reforming the body's metabolic state, fine-tuning the balance of insulin and circulating glucose, and regulating appetite to help control body weight through healthy food selection. It also enhances cognitive function by improving our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions, while recalibrating emotional brain circuits to better navigate social and psychological challenges.","['Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical\ndecisions and choices.

The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\n    sleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.\n\n## The circadian rhythm\n\nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:'
 ""* When you want to be awake or asleep.\n* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.\n* Your moods and emotions\n* The amount of urine you produce.\n* Your core body temperature.\n* Your metabolic rate.\n* The release of numerous hormones.\n\nContrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun\ncycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:\n\n* When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on\n    maintaining the rhythm.\n* The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an\n    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nEven if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay\nto stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one\nhour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.\n\nThat reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently\nfly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:\n\n* The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,\n    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of\n    timezone travel.\n* Their short term memory was significantly impaired.\n* They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general\n    population.\n\nThe peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,\nit's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and\nit's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of\npeople:\n\n* *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the\n    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and\n    function optimally at this time of day.\n* *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late\n    the following morning, or even in the afternoon.\n* *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight\n    leaning towards eveningness.\n\n### Melatonin""
 'An enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.\n\nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to\nfunction and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.\n\nFor the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on\nbuilding up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging\nchemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.\nOnce your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you\nare hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before\nyou drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated\nin the hours in between.\n\n## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure\n\nThe two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.\nAlthough they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.\n\n![ ](sleep_two_factors_regulating_sleep.jpg)\n\nStarting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase\nits activity a few hours before you wake up.

"What role does fluoride play with brushing to fight cavities, especially in plaque-prone areas?","Fluoride in toothpaste (dentifrice) is an important protective factor against caries, helping to neutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, particularly in plaque-prone areas where cavities are more likely to occur.","[""Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.\n\nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.\n\nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.\n\nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.\n\nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day.

 ""General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.\n\nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.\n\n## Teeth brushing\n\nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).\n\nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.\n\nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.\n\nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.\n\nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.""
 ""Some people are prone to cavities, or might have poor dental health. If your\nteeth chip, crack or break easily, it’s strongly recommended that you don't\nrinse after you brush.

One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.\n\nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))""
 ""Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood.\n\n### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility.\n[1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush.\n\n### To rinse or not to rinse\n\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth.

 'There\'s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish. As soon as you want to coordinate the actions of more than a handful of people, you need a reliable, agreed-upon method of measuring time. This is why the first mechanical clocks came to be invented. \n\nMaking time standardized and visible in this fashion inevitably encourages people to think of it as an abstract thing with an independent existence, distinct from the specific activities on which one might spend it. ""time"" is what ticks away as the hands move around the clock face.\n\nThe next step was to start treating time as a resource, something to be bought and sold and used as efficiently as possible. This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, ant to berate yourself when you feel you\'ve wasted it. When you\'re faced with too many demands, it\'s easy to assume that the only answer must be to make *better use* of time, by becoming more efficient, driving yourself harder, or working longer instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable.\n\nSoon your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you\'re using time: it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you fell you need to dominate or control if you\'re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this attitude towards time sets up a rigged game in which it\'s impossible ever to feel as though you\'re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally ""out of the way"".'

How do NREM pruning and REM strengthening aid memory during sleep?,"NREM pruning aids memory during sleep by removing unnecessary neural connections, while REM strengthening plays a role in reinforcing the important connections. This process helps the brain manage its limited capacity for memories by optimizing which connections to keep and which to remove.","[""A key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.\n\nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.\n\n## Sleeping time and sense distortions\n\nWhen you're asleep, you loose awareness of the outside world. Your ears are\nstill hearing, your eyes, though closed, are still seeing, and the rest of the\norgans keep on working too.\n\nAll these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it's there, in\nthe sensory convergence zone, where they end. The thalamus is the sensory gate\nto the brain that blocks them. If it lets them pass, they travel\nto the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By\nlocking its gates shut when you're asleep, the thalamus imposes a sensory\nblackout in the brain. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the\ninformation transmitted from your sense organs.""
 ""## The sleep cycle\n\nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.\n\nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.\n\n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)\n\nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.\n\nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:\n\n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\n    which to remove.""
 'Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical\ndecisions and choices. It recalibrates our emotional brain circuits, allowing us\nto navigate next day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed\ncomposture.\n\nDownstairs in the body, sleep:\n\n* Restocks the armory of our immune system: helping fight malignancy, preventing\n    infection, and warding off sickness.\n* Reforms the body\'s metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and\n    circulating glucose.\n* Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food\n    selection rather than rash impulsivity.\n* Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut essential to our\n    nutritional health being.\n* Is tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure\n    while keeping our hearts in fine condition.\n\nDreaming produces a neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and\na virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge,\ninspiring creativity.\n\nTherefore, **Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our\nbrain and body health each day**.\n\n# Sleep physiological effects\n\nThere are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:\n\n* The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.\n* Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates\n    the ""sleep pressure"". The longer you\'ve been awake, the more that chemical\n    sleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.\n\n## The circadian rhythm\n\nWe have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,\nthat makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,\nrespectively. The circadian rhythm determines:'
 ""Another consequence of sleeping is a sense of time distortion experienced in two\ncontradictory ways. While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep,\nat a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible\nprecision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams. The\nsignature patterns of brain-cell activity that occurs as you learn, gets\nrecurrently repeated during sleep. That is, memories are being replayed at the\nlevel of brain-cell activity as you sleep. During REM sleep, the memories are\nreplayed at half or quarter the speed in comparison of the activity when you're\nawake. This slow neural recounting may be the reason why we have that time\ndilation.\n\n# How your brain generates sleep\n\nBrainwave activity of REM sleep looks similar to the one you have when you're\nawake. They cycle (going up and down) at a fast frequency of thirty or forty\ntimes per second in an unreliable pattern. This behaviour is explained by the\nfact that different parts of your waking brain are processing different pieces\nof information at different moments in time and in different ways.\n\n![ ](brainwaves.jpg)\n\n# References\n\n* [Why we sleep book by Matthew Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)\n- [The forgotten medieval habit of two sleeps](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep)\n- [Jet lag calculator](https://www.sleepjunkie.com/jet-lag-calculator/)\n[![](not-by-ai.svg){: .center}](https://notbyai.fyi)""
