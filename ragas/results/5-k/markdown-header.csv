What does the American Dental Association recommend regarding the use of dental floss in daily oral hygiene?,"The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of one's daily oral hygiene regime, using a different piece of floss at each flossing session.","[""## [How to floss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing)  \nTooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as\n40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access\nthese areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can\nremove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be\nremoved by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of\none's daily oral hygiene regime, [with a different piece of\nfloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene#Oral_hygiene) at each flossing\nsession.  \nThe correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows:\n([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene#Flossing),\n[2](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/))  \n* Floss length: 15–25 cm wrapped around middle fingers.\n* For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth\nwith both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left\nbetween the fingers.\n* Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not\nsnap the floss into the gums.\n* When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth\nuntil you feel resistance.\n* Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving\nthe floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the\nside of the next tooth.\n* Do not forget the back of your last tooth.\n* Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up\nand down motion.  \nYou should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and\nbacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.  \nAnother [tips regarding flossing\nare](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/floss-before-or-after-brushing#other-tips):  \n* Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove\nfood stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and\nlead to an infection.\n* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.  \nWhen you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier.  If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly.""

It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis).  \nGeneral guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.\nThere are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.  \nOver 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts\nof the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.'
 ""## Teeth brushing  \nRoutine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29).  \nThe dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after\nyou've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until\nit reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes\nisn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.  \nBacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral\nout of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.  \nSo controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.  \nMany oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal.  \nToothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.  \nToothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing.\nThe fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed.\nPeople use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin.  \nFor maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay.  \nAt night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your\nteeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks.\nThat's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque\nbacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after\nbrushing at night. This also gives fluoride the longest opportunity to work.""

How does your environment shape habits?,"Your environment shapes habits by creating cues that trigger behaviors. Over time, habits become associated with the entire context surrounding the behavior rather than a single trigger. A new environment can help establish new habits by removing subtle triggers from the old environment. Rearranging your current environment can also create obvious visual cues that draw attention to desired habits, increasing the likelihood of thinking about them throughout the day. Once a habit is encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear, reinforcing both good and bad habits.","[""### Use the environment to tweak your cues  \nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. This stacks over itself and your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. The context or the environment is then the invisible hand that shapes behaviours. They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.  \nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits. When you can't manage to get an entirely new environment, you can redefine or rearrange your current one.  \nWhen building good habits you can rearrange the environment to create obvious visual cues that draw your attention towards the desired habit. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.  \nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.  \nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while. That means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. In the short run it may work. In the long run, as self-control is an exhausting task that consumes willpower, we become a product of the environment we live in. Trying to change a habit with self-control is doomed to fail as you may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. It's also very hard and frustrating to try to achieve change when you're under the mood influences of a bad habit.  \nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Tweak the environment to make the cue virtually impossible to happen. That way you won't even have the chance to fall for the craving.""
 ""A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.  \nA [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.  \nWhen behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.  \nMastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.""
 ""### Align your personal identity change with an existent shared identity  \nWe pick up habits from the people around us. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal one. This transforms your personal identity transformation into the building of a shared one. Shared identities have great benefits over single ones:  \n- They foster belonging. A powerful feeling that creates motivation.\n- They are more resilient: When one falters others will take their place so all together you'll guarantee the maintenance of the identity.\n- They create friendship and community\n- They expose you to an environment where more habits tied to that identity thrive.  \nLikewise, if you're trying to run from a bad habit cut your ties to communities that embrace that habit.""
 '## Select which habits you want to work with  \nOur responses to the cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. The author suggests to do a list of your daily habits and rate them positively, negatively or neutral under the judgement of whether it brings you closer to the desired person you want to be.  \nI find this approach expensive time-wise if you already have a huge list of habits to work with.

 ""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.  \nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you\ninstead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep\nNREM sleep. Preventing the brain to have the required REM or NREM daily rations\nresults in many physical and mental issues.""

Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""
 '### Caffeine  \nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively\ninactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.  \nLevels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is\nproblematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes\nbetween five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration\nfrom your body.  \nAn enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.  \nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*.

 '### Caffeine  \nYou can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that\nmakes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by\nbattling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors\nin the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them\nlike adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively\ninactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.  \nLevels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is\nproblematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes\nbetween five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration\nfrom your body.  \nAn enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large\npart on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that\ndegrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.\nAge is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it\ntakes our brain and body to remove it.  \nWhen your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the\n*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to\nfunction and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.  \nFor the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on\nbuilding up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging\nchemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.\nOnce your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you\nare hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before\nyou drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated\nin the hours in between.'
 ""### All-nighters  \nScientists can demonstrate that the two forces determining when you want to be\nawake and sleep are independent and can be decoupled from their normal lockstep.  \nWhen you skip one night's sleep and remain awake throughout the following day,  \n![ ](sleep_all_nighter.jpg)  \nBy remaining awake, and blocking access to the adenosine drain that sleep opens\nup, the brain is unable to rid itself of the chemical sleep pressure. The\nmounting adenosine levels continue to rise. This should mean that the longer you\nare awake, the sleepier you feel. But that's not true. Though you will feel\nincreasingly sleepy throughout the nighttime phase, hitting a low point in your\nalertness around five or six in the morning, thereafter, you'll start to be more\nawake.  This effect is answered by the energy return of the circadian rhythm.\nUnlike sleep pressure, the circadian rhythm pays no attention to whether you are\nasleep or awake.""
 ""### Am I getting enough sleep?  \nWhen you don't sleep enough, one consequence among many is that adenosine\nconcentrations remain too high, so the next morning you continue to accumulate\nsleep debt  \nIf after waking up you could fall asleep at ten or eleven in the morning, it\nmeans that you're likely not getting enough sleep quantity or quality. The same\ncan be said if you can't function optimally without caffeine before noon, you'll\nbe most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.  \nOther sleep indicators can be if you would sleep more if you didn't set an alarm\nclock, or if you find yourself at your computer screen reading and then\nrereading the same sentence.  \nOf course, even if you are giving yourself plenty of time to get a full night of\nshut-eye, next-day fatigue and sleepiness can still occur because you are\nsuffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder.""

 ""## The sleep cycle  \nHumans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the\nnight with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid\neye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate\nstages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names `(҂⌣̀_⌣́)`). Stages 3 and 4 are the\ndeepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in\ncomparison with stages 1 and 2.  \nIn REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This\nmovement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those\nobserved when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the\nbrainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.  \n![ ](sleep_cycle.jpg)  \nEven though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to\nREM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of\nthe night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM.\nBut as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts\ndominating.  \nAlthough there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and\nupdate our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but\nasymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are\nstored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to\nmove the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain\nneeds to solve an optimization problem:  \n* The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.\n* The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.\n* The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and\nwhich to remove.  \nA key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while\nREM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles\nand the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them.\nThe asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from\na block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM\nextensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic\nform. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.  \nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time.

How does smooth exercise transition affect muscle coordination and strength in Pilates?,"Smooth exercise transitions in Pilates require every muscle to coordinate in order to share the load of the weight. This coordination is challenging because the stronger muscles are used more, while the weaker, often forgotten muscles are engaged through Pilates positions and slow transitions.

In order to keep the lower abdominals close to\nthe spine, the breathing needs to be directed to the back and sides of the lower rib\ncage. When exhaling, you need to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet\ntowel dry. To do that you need to contract the deep abdominal and pelvic floor\nmuscles, feeling your bellybutton going to your back and a little bit up.
