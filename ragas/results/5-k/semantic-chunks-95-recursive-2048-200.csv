 ""Moreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time. Our culture's ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want, because it's scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships. In the end the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. The truth then is that freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community. Participating in forms of social life where you don't get to decide exactly what you do or when you doi it.

When should you change your toothbrush to ensure effective cleaning?,You should change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility to ensure effective cleaning.,"['Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29). The dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants.'
 '??? note ""TL;DR: Daily actions to keep your teeth healty""\n    * [Brush your teeth](#how-to-brush-your-teeth) after every meal for at least two minutes. * [Floss each day](#how-to-floss) before the last teeth brush. * Use an [electric toothbrush](#manual-versus-electric-tooth-brush). * [Replace the brush](#toothbrush-replacement) each three months or at first\n        sign of wear and tear. * Don\'t eat or drink anything but water after your nightly brush. * [Do not rinse after you brush your teeth](#to-rinse-or-not-to-rinse). * [Use floss instead of a toothpick](#how-to-floss). * [Use mouthwash daily but not after brushing](#mouth-washing). Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one\'s mouth clean and free of disease\nand other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental\nhygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be\ncarried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad\nbreath. The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis). General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts'
 ""If the process isn't\nstopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities. So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from\nplaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for\na minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally\nafter each meal. Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival\npockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect\nthe ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of\npathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as\nnano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective\nfactor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize\nalready affected [enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel). However,\nin terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the\neffectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it\nperforms the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is\na neurotoxin. For maximum benefit, [use toothpaste with 1350-1500\nppmF](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868/ORAL_fluoride-toothpastes-different-strengths-preventing-tooth-decay)\n(that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth\ndecay. At night, you produce less saliva than during the day.""
 ""Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at\nthe gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the\nbristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions\nat that angle. When using an electric one, the bristle head should be guided from tooth to\ntooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The\nmotion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush\nor make circles. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133541) suggest\nthat the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and\ngingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes. Regardless of the type, you are always best using a soft-bristled toothbrush\nwith a small head and a flexible neck because this will most effectively remove\nplaque and debris from your teeth, without damaging your teeth and gums and\ndrawing blood. ### Toothbrush replacement\n\nRemember to replace your brush at the first sign of wear-and-tear or every three\nmonths, whichever comes first. Frayed or broken bristles won't clean your mouth\nproperly. Change your toothbrush once the bristles lose their flexibility. [1](https://www.gtorthodontics.com/11-mistakes-avoid-brushing-teeth/)\n\nAlso, after a couple of months of daily use, bacteria and food particles begin to\naccumulate on the toothbrush. ### To rinse or not to rinse\n\nThere is a lot of controversy on the topic on whether you should rinse or not\nyour mouth after brushing your teeth. ([1](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/03/health/dental-health-tips-partner/index.html),\n[2](https://implantandcosmeticdentistry.com/should-you-be-rinsing-your-mouth-with-water-after-brushing/))\n\nPeople in favor of rinsing your mouth argue that:""
 ""* Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums. When you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little. Carry\non flossing your teeth and the bleeding should stop as your gums become\nhealthier. If you're still getting regular bleeding after a few days, see your\ndental team. They can check if you're flossing correctly. ## Mouth washing\n\nUsing a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't\nuse mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll\nwash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth. [[1](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/)]\n\nChoose a different time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch.

What are the 4 stages linking motivation to habit outcomes?,"The four stages linking motivation to habit outcomes are: Reward, Cue, Cravings, and Response.","['A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. A [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition. When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.'
 'As it\'s my case I\'ll skip this part. You can read it in more detail in the chapter ""4: The Man Who Didn\'t Look Right"". ## Working with the habit cues\n\nThe first place to start the habit design is to understand and tweak the triggers that produce them. We\'ll do it by:\n\n- [Clearly formulating the habits to change](#clearly-formulate-the-habit-you-want-to-change)\n- [Stacking habits](#habit-stacking)\n- [Using the environment to tweak your cues](#use-the-environment-to-tweak-your-cues)\n\n### Clearly formulate the habit you want to change\n\nThe cues that can trigger an habit can come in a wide range of forms but the two most common are time and location. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention and pull you off course. And with enough repetition, you will get the urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\'t say why. That\'s why it\'s interesting to formulate your habits as ""I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]"". You want the cue to be highly specific and immediately actionable. If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off. If you aren\'t sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start. ### Habit stacking'
 ""This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. Mastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance. # How to manage habits\n## Track your habit management\nYou can have a `habits.org` file where you prioritize, analyze, track them. I'm using the next headings:\n\n* *Habits being implemented*: It's subdivided in two:\n  * Habits that need attention\n  * Habits that don't need attention\n* *Unclassified habits*: Useful when refiling habits from your inbox. This list will be analyzed when you do habit analysis. * *Backlog of habits*: Unrefined and unordered list of habits\n* Implemented habits:\n* Rejected habits:\n\nEach habit is a `TODO` item with the usual states: `TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`, `REJECTED`. In it's body I keep a log of the evolution and the analysis of the habit. ## Habit management workflow\n\nEach month I'm trying to go through the list of habits to:\n\n- Update the state of the habits: Some will be done, rejected or to register ideas about them. - Decide which ones need attention.""

The most common types of dental disease are [tooth\ndecay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities, dental caries) and\ngum diseases, including [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis),\nand [periodontitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis). General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before\ngoing to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning\nbetween the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth\nbrushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and\ntherefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental\nbrushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach\nfood left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to\nneutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts'
 'Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases,\nand perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce\n[dental plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) and\n[tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_%28dental%29). The dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky\nbyproducts and food remnants.']",0.99999999998,1.0

 ""There is a widespread feeling that we're always short on time. We're obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening todo lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. At the same time we're deluged with advice on living the fully optimized life to squeeze the most from your time.
