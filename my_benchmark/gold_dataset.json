This activating signal peaks by early afternoon, contributing to feelings of wakefulness. As the day progresses, particularly by eleven pm, the circadian rhythm begins to descend, reducing activity and alertness levels, which triggers a strong desire for sleep."

It can result in a constant struggle to dominate or control time, making it difficult to appreciate moments for their own sake rather than their usefulness for future goals."

There are three types of chronotypes: morning types, evening types, and those in between. Melatonin plays a role in signaling the body when it's time to sleep, as the suprachiasmatic nucleus releases melatonin into the bloodstream after dusk, increasing its levels to indicate sleep time. However, melatonin itself has little influence on the generation of sleep."

Melatonin is released by the suprachiasmatic nucleus to signal that it's time to sleep, increasing in concentration after dusk and decreasing during the night. Adenosine, on the other hand, accumulates while you are awake, increasing the desire to sleep by turning down wake-promoting regions in the brain. While melatonin helps initiate sleep, adenosine builds up sleep pressure, and both factors work independently to regulate sleep."

Melatonin is released by the suprachiasmatic nucleus to signal that it's time to sleep, increasing in concentration after dusk and decreasing during the night. Adenosine, on the other hand, accumulates while you are awake, increasing the desire to sleep by turning down wake-promoting regions in the brain. While melatonin helps initiate sleep, adenosine builds up sleep pressure, and both factors work independently to regulate sleep."

Melatonin is released by the suprachiasmatic nucleus to signal that it's time to sleep, increasing in concentration after dusk and decreasing during the night. Adenosine, on the other hand, accumulates while you are awake, increasing the desire to sleep by turning down wake-promoting regions in the brain. While melatonin helps initiate sleep, adenosine builds up sleep pressure, and both factors work independently to regulate sleep."
