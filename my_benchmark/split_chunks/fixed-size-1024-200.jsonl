It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,\nwho break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed\niterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two\nweeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,\ncalled daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to\ndemonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and\na sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks.\n\nFor my personal scrum workflow and in the DevOps and DevSecOps teams I've found\nthat Sprint goals are not operative, as multiple unrelated tasks need", "type": "Document"}

If there is room for doubt the implementation will suffer. Continuously refine the habit definitions as you catch the exceptions that drift you off.\n\nIf you aren't sure of when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher as you get the feeling of a fresh start.\n\n### Habit stacking\n\nMany behaviours are linked together where the action of the first is the cue that triggers the next one.

Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. The catch is that the new habit should have the same frequency as the established one. \n\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming over:\n\n- The list of your current habits.\n- A new list of things that always happen to you with that frequency.\n\nWith these two lists, you can begin searching for the best triggers for the stack.\n\n### Use the environment to tweak your cues\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour.

They are not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. \n\nA new environment is a good foundation to make new habits, as you are free from the subtle triggers that nudge you toward your current habits.

This is why bad habits reinforce themselves. As you carry through the behaviour you spiral into a situation where the craving keeps growing and points you to keep on going with the same response. For example watching TV makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don't have the energy to do anything else.\n\nEven if you manage to break a habit, you are unlikely to forget it's cues even if you don't do it for a while.

This anticipation, and not the fulfillment of it, is what gets us to take action. \n\nIf we make a habit more attractive it will release more dopamine which will gives us more motivation to carry it through. \n\nTemptation bundling works by pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time. In the end you may even look forward to do the habit you need as it's related to the habit you want.\n\n### Align your personal identity change with an existent shared identity\n\nWe pick up habits from the people around us.

With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more\nenhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.\n\nA danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM\nsleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours\ninstead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even\nthough you are losing 25% of your total sleep time.

You milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time.

In those days before clocks, when you did need to explain how long something might take, your only option was to compare it with some other concrete activity. They were untroubled by any notion of time \"ticking away\" thus living a heightened awareness of the vividness of things, the feeling of timelesness. Also known as living in deep time, or being in the flow, when the boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry and time stands still.\n\nThere's one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which is that it severely limits what you can accomplish.

This mindset shift serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today.

You realize that all the time you've saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop.

It's true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down.\n\nIt also has another side-effect. As life accelerates, everyone grows more impatient. It's somehow vastly more aggravating to wait two minutes for the microwave than two hours for the oven, or ten seconds for a slow loading web page versus three days to receive the same information by mail.\n\nDenying reality never works though.

Instead, the endless struggle leads to more anxiety and less fulfilling life.

And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they're really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it's painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won't have time for all you once dreamed you might do.

We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance, or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won't be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life, because you needn't risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project if you never even start it.

Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all.

Which isn't actually a problem anyway, it turns to, because \"missing out\" is what makes your choices meaningful in the first place. Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn't, and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you. \n\n### Embrace your control limits\nThe more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constrains of being human, the more stressful, empt", "type": "Document"}
